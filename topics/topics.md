Whilst I try my very best to limit the number of topics, I must admit, their numbers have grown over the years. I would like to implement a way to section them by year as well but until I do---or decide against it---I'm afraid this is the best I can offer you.

All the topics. With their frequency count. Sorted alphabetically---at least as close to it as Jekyll permits.

And before you ask; No, I don't know why Jekyll puts the very first entry by its own topic at the end. But as soon as I figure it out, I'll get it fixed. It's probably a mistake on my end anyway.
