Other memorable entries include; making sure everyone knows [how I want to be buried][mortem], [living on a meal replacement beverage][joylent], talking about [all my tattoos][ink], gaining a deeper understanding for [the misogyny women and marginalised people go through every day][misogyny], suddenly [looking for a job][employment] again, [the special kind of hell that commuting is][dante], finding the right words to explain [that thing that I do that people pay me to do][commonwords] and trying my swiping finger at [dating in the 21st century][dating].

But my favourite entry is [That Place Between Sleep and Awake][sleep], where I write the hardest entry to date and talk about the sadness and grief that came with losing Amanda.
