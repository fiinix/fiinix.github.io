Other memorable event include; making sure everyone knows how I want to be buried, living on a meal replacement beverage, talking about all my tattoos, gaining a deeper understanding for the misogyny women and marginalised people go through every day, suddenly looking for a job again, the special kind of hell that commuting is, finding the right words to explain that thing that I do that people pay me to do and trying my swiping finger at dating in the 21st century.
