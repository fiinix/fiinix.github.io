As each year comes to its close I summarise it here, include my favourite entry and give you a list of all the entries.

I'm also migrating all the entries from my old Blogger+Blogspot account and [the migration progress][reclaimer] is publicly available on a Trello board.

But my favourite entry is [Back to the Past][backpast], where in honour of Marty McFly's arrival in the future, I wander through the past 12 years of web design for carloseriksson.com and look at the different, sometimes bad, design decisions I have made throughout the years.

## 2013

I have 106 entries in need of migration from this year.

<!-- Between releasing a game called Monorun and designing a Hanna-Barbera character, I finally started catching up with all the games I had on my to-play list.

Favourite entry from this year? Maybe, [The Worst Assassin in the World][assassin], where I recount my failures playing Hitman: Absolution. I still get a nice chuckle from that one.
