The basic plan for this page is simple. List each year as they pass, add annotations to match, with links to some of my----or someone else's---favourite posts. End it all with a link to the entire archive. Maybe include the most frequent topics tags as well? Maybe?

I plan on migrating all my posts from Blogger to here. Which will take some time, because they need to cleaned up and formatted for markdown and I'd rather do it slowly and good then rush it. I say that now, but I might change my mind too.

##2014

The year that hasn't reached an introspective status yet.


##2013
The year of the snake. That most vile and slithering of creatures. Or intelligent, but with a tendency to be somewhat unscrupulous if you believe Wikipedia. May. The month named after the Greek goddess Maia. That skanky little goddess of fertility.

Anyway. The post count is at about 340 and by now I have a staple of patterns by which I draw upon. I write about gaming, old as well as new but mostly old because my list of games to play is a bit behind. Most recently I finished Portal 2. Before that I played Hitman: Absolution and wrote about how terrible I was. I write about coffee and the theme of this year is roasting my own. I do meticulous research using Google and design charts to go with the results I get. I'm still reading books from my 1001 Books To Read Before You Die list — which I would like to have as an online list — but to be frank I am probably going to die before I read them all. Old age and such. I write and record my own songs as well as butcher other artists' work. I design things too — all sorts of things — and occasionally even write about them.

##2012
By May 2012 I had written a total of ~230 posts but I also had a — not — surprisingly low number of posts in the beginning of the year, because I've been too busy looking for job in England. But when I do find the time to write posts it's about the usual things, such as playing old games like Fallout, redesigning the Windows 8 logo, comparing the levels of hate for days of the week and I make an attempt to blend in with the indigenous population as I fly — all on my own — to England for a couple of interviews.

##2011
 May. This writing, me good. Words to make sense, yes. 150 times me write.

By now I have actually — like for rizzles — gotten the hang of writing with a certain amount of internal consistency. But instead of writing interesting and thought-provoking Pulitzer price worthy material I write about coffee. In May I discover the wonderful world of fresh coffee. After that I pretty much talk about nothing but coffee. I talk about coffee here, here, here, here and here. Oh, and here. And then I talk about coffee some more.

##2010
By May 2010 I have about 60 posts under my belt and have by now mastered the art of this “writing” thing. By now I have written posts about a wide — not really — variety of topics, such as my now defunct but back then new-ish laptop, growing my own herbs, how the A.I on Easy in Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun Firestorm shows me how it's really done and consequently kick my ass. Occasionally I remember that half of the name of the blog is “Design” at which point I write a post about how I should write more posts about design related stuff. Then I forgot all about it again. Already one can start to discern patterns in the things I write about as well as how I write about them.

##2009
And thus we have arrived at May 2009. Ironically, the first post in 2009 — where I try to resurrect my blog — is about a year after the post we just talked about. Apparently, I tried to do something that failed. I have no idea what I was trying to accomplish. But one can clearly tell that I'm beginning to get the hang of this “writing” thing people talk about because one day after post #2 I write post #3 and this time I actually have something to write about, specifically the dolls I am exhibiting at the time. A few days later I write yet another post, this time mostly pictures of the dolls but still.

##2008
The year is 2008---the 18th of May to be specific---and based on the first post and the frequency that follows I can only conclude that I hadn't quite figured out what this “writing” stuff was really about. Which is why the year 2008 will forever be the year when I write one measly post and then seemingly forget that I even have a blog for over a year. Yes, the shame and public humiliation. But ever since I started writing — with more frequency obviously — I've always strived to not really edit myself. Once I've published a post it's there. Done. No backsies. Occasionally it's felt warranted to make minor edits but the idea has always been/is that, spelling mistakes and all, whatever I've written should act as a time stamp of my cognitive and metacognitive abilities.
