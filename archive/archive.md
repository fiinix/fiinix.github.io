As each years comes to a close I summarise them here, include my favourite entry from that year and link to a list of all the entries.

I'm also migrating all the entries from my old Blogger+Blogspot account and [the migration progress][reclaimer] is publicly available on a Trello board.

##2015

The year that hasn't reached an introspective status yet.

##2014

The year [started out pretty badly][lupus], but thankfully got progressively better as time went by.

My favourite entry is definitely [A Letter from the Promised Land][promised-land], where I pretend to be a turn of the 20th century immigrant who is writing home to the family and friends he has left behind for a brighter future in the new world.

##2013

Between releasing a game called Monorun and designing a Hanna-Barbera character, I finally started catching up with all the games I had on my to-play list.

Favourite entry from this year? Maybe, [The Worst Assassin in the World][assassin], where I recount my failures playing Hitman: Absolution. I still get a nice chuckle from that one.

##2009

My favourite entry has got to be one of my live performances from Night of Arts, specifically [Part III & IV, “Into The Night” And “Made of Glass”][glass]. Let's be honest though, most of the other entries are quite terrible.
