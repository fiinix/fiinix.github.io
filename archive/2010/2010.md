Other memorable entries include; [playing Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun Firestorm][cc], conducting an [embarrassing interview with myself][interview], pretending I had a shot at playing [Romeo in Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet][leo] and continuing the work on [my board game Island of Eternity][prototype].

But my most memorable entry is [P-P-P-Poker Table][poker], where I design and build an octagonal poker table out of birch and European pruce.
