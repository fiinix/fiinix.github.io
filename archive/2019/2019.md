Other memorable entries include; [tracking my moods][motherforking] for a year, continuing to learn [what well-being truly means][vitruvian], [travelling back to my first love][thankdance] and how it shaped me, going behind the scenes on [making a Skillshare class][skillshare] and getting awarded [BIMA's Champion for Change][bima].

But my most memorable entry is [What I Learned from Running a Marathon][brightonmarathon], where I finally manage to complete my first marathon.
