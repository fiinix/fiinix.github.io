Other memorable entries include; designing and [selling my own series of T-shirts][tees], getting obsessed with [drinking fresh coffee][coffee], recording my original song [My Undying Love For You Will Never Decompose (But My Body Might)][decompose], revealing the next, brand-spanking [new version of our NHL statistics tracking tool][nhl] and auditioning for [the reality television-music competition Idols][idols].

But my favourite entry is [The Luckiest F.O.B in the World(s)][fob], where Rebecka and I get married.
