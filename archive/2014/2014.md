Other memorable entries include; [Lucien getting seriously ill][lupus], [a 24 h board game marathon][board], [going to my first Comic Con][comic], [turning thirty][thirty], [getting a new jobs][job], [growing a beard for a year][beard] and [hunting for the perfect Christmas tree][tree].

But my most memorable entry is [A Letter from the Promised Land][promised-land], where I pretend to be a turn of the 20th century immigrant who is writing home to the family and friends he has left behind for a brighter future in the new world.
