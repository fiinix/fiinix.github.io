Other memorable entries include; [starting to exercise][exercise], [becoming a zombie for a day][zombie], [speaking at my first conference][webinthewoods], [becoming a published writer][netmag], [completing the year-long beard journey][beard] and [toasting to the ten terrific years][tenyears] spent with Rebecka.

But my most memorable entry is [Back to the Past][backpast], where in honour of Marty McFly's arrival in the future, I wander through the past 12 years of web design for carloseriksson.com and look at the different, sometimes bad, design decisions I have made throughout the years.
