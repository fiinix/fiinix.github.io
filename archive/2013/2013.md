Other memorable entries include; recounting [my failures playing Hitman: Absolution][assassin], [re-imagining my avatar as Hanna-Barbera character][greatness], getting way too invested in [this year's Eurovision Song Contest][eurovision], [releasing a game called Monorun!][monorun], [folding some amazing paper planes][paperplanes], [realising that I can't tell the difference between Coca-Cola and Pepsi][cocacola], [drinking the world's strongest coffee][deathwishcoffee] and [determining which mince pies are the best][mincepies]

But my favourite entry is [A Rainy Night on Drury Lane, Part VII â€” A White Blanket of Forgiveness][rainy-finish], where I finally finish the multi-part short story I started the year before.
