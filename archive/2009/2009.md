Other memorable entries include; [creating sculpted dolls][dolls], a horrible [bucket list][bucket], [performing covers and my own material at Night of Arts][nightart], [getting a third tattoo][tattoo3] and [designing an T-shirt for Xbox.com][xbox].

But my favourite entry is one of my live performances from Night of Arts, specifically [Part III & IV, “Into The Night” And “Made of Glass”][glass].
