excerpt: "I'm an **accessibility-focused multilingual designer** and frontend developer who knows that inclusive design can exist in the heart of form and function, without compromising either. "

For the past six years I've been making websites and experiences that are **accessible and usable** for everyone. I focus on typography, information architecture and inclusive design patterns.

From having the pleasure of [writing][writing] about accessibility for Net magazine to [speaking at conferences][speaking] about the importance of accessibility and having other work used by tens of thousands of people on a daily basis, my wonderful wife and son always keep me grounded.

I wouldnâ€™t be half the man I am without them.

Born and raised in [Finland][vasa], we now live in the <abbr title="United Kingdom" class="small-caps">UK</abbr>. A few years ago we packed a bag each and moved here for what, so far, has been quite [an adventure][adventure].

Inquisitive and critical by nature, I get genuinely excited about learning new things whether it&rsquo;s another tool to add to the arsenal or baking exquisitely complicated cupcakes.
