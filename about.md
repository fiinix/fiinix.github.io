From having the pleasure of having some of my work featured on xbox.com and other work seen by tens of thousands of people on a daily basis, my wonderful wife always keeps me grounded.

Originally from a cold but sunny Finland, my family and I now live in the <abbr title="United Kingdom" class="small-caps">UK</abbr>. We packed a bag each and moved here for what, so far, has been quite the adventure.

Inquisitive and critical by nature, I get genuinely excited about learning new things whether it&rsquo;s another tool to add to the arsenal or baking exquisitely complicated cupcakes.
