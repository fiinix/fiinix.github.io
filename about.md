Since working closely with people with permanent mental and physical disabilities back in Finland ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®, Carlos has been on an over **decade-long quest to make the web better for everyone**, not just the people it is easy for.

His hands-on experience supporting and helping people live independent lives and seeing the broken state of the web they had to endure became the driving force for change.

Since then, he's been championing to create a more inclusive technology industry by first recognising exclusion.

It's only through the lens of exclusion, and the mismatch it creates between people and technology that we can understand how vital it is that we include everyone; from people with permanent, temporary and situational disabilities to marginalised and underrepresented groups.

From **collaborating with charities**, such as Kent Association for the Blind where he led user-testing with people with visual impairments, to **educating stakeholders and teams** at agencies of the Cabinet Office with paradigm-shifting lessons and workshops his stories always comes back to people.

> At the end of the day, the web is still built by people, for people. <cite>[What are you doing for an inclusive web today?][article]</cite>

By partnering, in his capacity at Studio 24, with **country-wide reshaping major projects**, such as HS2 and Heathrow Expansion, Carlos' impact can be seen in the barriers-to-entry he has removed.

By working with prolific charities, such as the Internet Watch Foundation and Fauna & Flora International, he has been **making sure their services reach as many people as possible**.

With [teaching], [public speaking][speaking] and by [writing in industry-recognised print publications][net], such as net magazine, he continues to educate and empower peers and people alike, on how to transform their organisations to make a better web for everyone.
