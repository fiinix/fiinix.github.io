This is the unofficial change from [fiinixdesign.blogspot.com](http://fiinixdesign.blogspot.com) to a Github hosted Jekyll powered blog. This post---will be deleted at a later point and only serves as a test in using `markdown` which has the potential to be my favourite syntax in---many ways. Provided I figure out how to deal with `figure` and `figcaption` because I'm going to need that. I also need to figure out how to enable smart quotes for `markdown`.
