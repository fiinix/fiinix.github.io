<h1>Style-guide</h1>

<p>This document is a guide to the mark-up styles used throughout the site. In particular it’s a check that all likely mark-up is styled appropriately.</p>

<h2>Sections (a Level 2 Heading)</h2>
<p>The secondary header above is an <code>h2</code> element, which may be used for any form of important page-level header.</p>

<h3>Level 3 Header</h3>
<p>The header above is an <code>h3</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h2</code> header in importance.</p>
<h3>Paragraphs</h3>

<p>All paragraphs are wrapped in p tags. Additionally, p elements can be wrapped with a blockquote element if the p element is indeed a quote.</p>

This is a paragraph directly following a paragraph. It should be indented with no gap between this and the prior paragraph.
<h3>Pre-formatted text</h3>

<p>The pre element represents a block of pre-formatted text. Here’s an example showing the printable characters of ASCII:</p>

<pre>
! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . /
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; < = > ?
@ A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O
P Q R S T U V W X Y Z [ \ ] ^ _
` a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o
p q r s t u v w x y z { | } ~
</pre>

<h3>Blockquotes</h3>

<p>The blockquote element represents a section that is being quoted from another source.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>At nine o'clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of
    chocolate on a tray, and opened the shutters. Dorian was sleeping quite
    peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his cheek.
    He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study.</p>

<p>The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as he
opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he had
been lost in some delightful dream. Yet he had not dreamed at all. His
night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain. But
youth smiles without any reason. It is one of its chiefest charms.</p>
<cite>A Picture of Dorian Gray</cite>
</blockquote>

<h3>Ordered list</h3>

<p>The ol element denotes an numbered list.</p>

    <ol><li>This is an ordered list. This is an ordered list. This is an ordered list.</li>
        <li>This is an ordered list. This is an ordered list.</li>
        <li>This is the second item, which contains a sub list
            <ol><li>This is the sub list, which is also ordered.</li>
                    <li>It has two items.</li></ol></li>
        <li>This is the final item on this list.</li></ol>

<h3>Unordered list</h3>

<p>The ul element denotes a bulleted list.</p>

    <ul><li>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:
            <ul><li>England</li>
                    <li>Scotland</li>
                    <li>Wales</li>
                    <li>Northern Ireland</li></ul></li>
        <li>Republic of Ireland</li>
        <li>Isle of Man</li>
        <li>Channel Islands:
            <ul><li>Bailiwick of Guernsey</li>
                    <li>Bailiwick of Jersey</li></ul></li></ul>

<h3>Definition list</h3>

<p>The dl element is for another type of list called a definition list. Instead of list items, the content of a dl consists of dt (Definition Term) and dd (Definition description) pairs.</p>

<dl><dt>This is a term.</dt>
    <dd>This is the definition of that term, which both live in a dl.</dd>
<dt>Here is another term.</dt>
    <dd>And it gets a definition too, which is this line.</dd>
<dt>Here is term that shares a definition with the term below.</dt>
<dt>Here is a defined term.</dt>
    <dd>dt terms may stand on their own without an accompanying dd, but in that case they share descriptions with the next available dt. You may not have a dd without a parent dt.</dd></dl>

<h3>Figures</h3>

<p>Figures are usually used to refer to images.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="http://placehold.it/710x399" alt="This is a placeholder image">
    <figcaption>This is an optional supporting caption. The <q>Figure #</q> is automatically added and its numbering is handled by the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>, freeing you to move the order around without having to worry about editing the <code>figure</code> at all.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Text-level Semantics</h3>

<p>There are a number of inline <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> elements you may use anywhere within other elements.</p>

<h3>Links and anchors</h3>
<p>Partly inspired by Mark Boulton and his article <a href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/sparkicons">Sparkicons and the humble Hyperlink</a>, this website attempts to use <dfn title="A small, inline icon with additional link meta data to describe either the content and/or the behaviour when the user clicks the link">Sparkicons</dfn> to enhance your reading experience. I say <q>attempts</q> because the verdict is still out on whether or not it works.</p>
<p>The following list is the current number of sparkicons available.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/">Inbound link</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.google.com">Outbound link</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.wikipedia.com">Wiki link</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com">Link to Youtube video</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Tags and topics</h3>
<p>This uses the <code>a</code> element with a <code>class='tag'</code>.</p>

<p><a href="/" class="tag">Tag</a>
<a href="/" class="tag">Another Tag</a>
<a href="/" class="tag">A Third Tag</a>
<a href="/" class="tag">A Tag: With Semicolon</a>
<a href="/" class="tag">The Penultimate Tag</a>
<a href="/" class="tag">The Last Tag</a></p>

<h3>Stressed emphasis</h3>

<h3>Citations</h3>

<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>The <code>dfn</code> element is used to highlight the <dfn>first use of a term</dfn>.</p>

<h3>Abbreviation</h3>
The <code>abbr</code> element is used for any abbreviated text, like Staffs. and BBC, the latter uses class='smcp' to specify small-caps.

<h3>Code</h3>
<p>The code element is used to represent fragments of computer code as we’ve seen through this page. Here it is used in conjunction with the pre element:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
    function getJelly() {
        echo $aDeliciousSnack;
    }
    </code>
</pre>

Superscript and subscript text

f(x, n) = log4xn
