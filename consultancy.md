<a href="mailto:carloserikssonconsultancy@gmail.com?subject=Let%E2%80%99s%20work%20together" class="link--tertiary">Let&rsquo;s talk</a> about how I can help you and your clients.

*I will also be providing workshops soon.*

## Why accessibility and inclusive design?

The social responsibility---the web is for everyone after all---should motivate business-owners but in reality it's often not enough.

The legal requirements---[The Equality Act 2010][equality]---and risk of lawsuits should be enough to deter us from excluding people, but looking at the web landscape makes it clear that's not enough either.

> 79% of tested websites fail to meet the bare minimum for accessibility. <cite><a href="http://carloseriksson.com/blog/a-finn-in-the-forest-part-ii/#carlos-eriksson">Speaking at Web in the Woods</a></cite>

Accessibility isn't about people with disabilities or meeting a criteria on a list, it's about people. Because people, of all ages, ethnicities and abilities *benefit from inclusive design*. People like me and you.

49.3% of people in the UK---at 31.2 million, that's almost half of the entire population---are 40 years or over.

As we age, our eyesâ€™ ability to focus degrade, called presbyopia, and we begin to struggle to focus and read small prints. Now imagine something as small---but significant---as insufficient text contrast alienating *half of your potential customers*.

I'm here, to make sure that doesn't happen.

## How it works

Your clients, and you, will benefit most from my expertise by including me as early as possible, at the proposal stage being the absolute best.

This way, we can discuss the pain points and challenges ahead and I can recommend the services that are most appropriate for the project.

<!-- Every client has unique problems that require unique solutions. -->

> I want to empower you and your clients to create designs for everyone.

From there onward, we work together to make your website inclusive and accessible to everyone.
