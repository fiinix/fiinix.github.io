excerpt: "This website is made possible thanks to the hard work of many people smarter than me."

Produced on an <code>1366×768</code> Toshiba laptop in rustic [Maidstone][maidstone], <abbr title="United Kingdom" class="small-caps">UK</abbr>, I tend to sketch with pen and paper to figure out design concepts before coding in Sublime Text.

Starting with the content first I'm taking inspiration from the canons of page construction and applying a flexible device-agnostic approach to it.

##Typography

The type is set in Lora by [Cyreal][cyreal] for body copy and Cooper Hewitt by [Chester Jenkins][chester] for headings. Both which are licensed under the SIL Open Font License.

##Technologies

This website is built with [Jekyll][jekyll], a ‘blog aware, static site generator’, and hosted on [GitHub Pages][source]. The source code is version controlled with Git and stored on GitHub.

The evolution this website is an experiment in iterating and building something out in the open, which is why its progress is available on a [public Trello board][trello].

All the pages are given semantic meaning with <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language" class="small-caps">HTML5</abbr> and the aesthetics are controlled by <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets" class="small-caps">CSS</abbr>.

Images are only loaded once you scroll to them with the help of [Lazy Load][lazy] by Mika Tuupola.
