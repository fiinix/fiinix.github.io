	<p><a href="http://carloseriksson.com/greedforgood">The slides from Accessibility = Money are available online</a>, but they only serve to enhance the points I make throughout my talk.</p>

	<p>Here&rsquo;s what the wonderful Dan Edwards had to say about my talk:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Carlos delivered an excellent talk on how accessibility can equate to a larger increase in company turnover using a combination of witty humor [sic] and facts around how business owners are missing a trick when it comes to building with accessibility in mind. <cite><a href="https://twitter.com/de">Dan Edwards</a></cite></p>
