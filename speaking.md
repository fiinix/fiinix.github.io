	<p>Where I made a business case for accessibility and talk about the very real cost of ignoring it.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>In his eye opening talk <a href="http://carloseriksson.com/greedforgood">Accessibility Equals Money</a>, Carlos bypasses the often dull technical aspects of accessibility and talks about human beings and the bottom line.</p>
		<p>The talk covers the real world implications of poor accessibility that will help you better empathise with people’s needs. But it’s also full of stats and soundbites to convince you, your boss, or your clients why accessibility makes financial sense. And it does!

	<p>As designer we need to speak to business-owners in a language they understand. We need to make a <a href="http://carloseriksson.com/greedforgood">business case for accessibility</a> and inclusive design.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Carlos delivered an excellent talk on how accessibility can equate to a larger increase in company turnover using a combination of witty humor and facts around how business owners are missing a trick when it comes to building with accessibility in mind. <cite><a href="https://twitter.com/de">Dan Edwards</a></cite></p>
