### The Cost of Accessibility

<time datetime="2015-12-03 19:00:00 GMT" class="timestamp timestamp--listing">Dec. 2015</time>

In which I make a business case for accessibility at [codeHarbour on Tour!][codeharbour] and talk about the very real cost of ignoring it.

> Carlos...talks about human beings and the bottom line. The talk covers the real world implications of poor accessibility that will help you better empathise with people’s needs. But it’s also full of stats and soundbites to convince you, your boss, or your clients why accessibility makes financial sense. And it does! <cite>[Andrew Fairlie][andrew]</cite>
