The short story is that Lucien's school arranged a language fair and part of the things Rebecka decided to bring was <i lang="sv">Kokosbollar</i>, a sensational treat that most Nordic children---and adults---will remember fondly.

Naturally they loved them---who wouldn't? They're basically sugared lumps of delicious fat---and she was asked for the recipe.

I figured, "Well, if they liked it, maybe others would too?"

So here we are. Besides, I've been dying to get hands-on with my new Canon 100D and this gave me the perfect excuse.

##Kokosbollar

Makes about 20 balls. <mark>Or 11 if you make them as big as I did.</mark>

	75 g butter
	54 g granulated sugar
	1 tsp vanilla extract
	12 g cacao
	130 g rolled oats
	1 tbsp water
	+
	desiccated coconut, for rolling.

###Directions

Mix together soft butter with sugar. <mark>Wait for it or violently beat it together, like it offended you.</mark>

Add the vanilla extract, cacao, rolled oats and water. Mix everything into an even batter. <mark>Make a double batch but get the math wrong and use 380 g of oats instead of 260 g.</mark>

Using your hands, roll the batter into small balls and put them on a plate.

Wash your hands. <mark>Or donâ€™t.</mark>

Pour some desiccated coconut into a plate and roll the balls in the coconut.

Store your Nordic treats in a jar in the fridge and enjoy a few here and there. Give perhaps some to your friends and family, after all, sharing is caring. <mark>Or eat everything within the first 30 minutes like the selfish bastard that you are and feel sick for the rest of the day.</mark>
