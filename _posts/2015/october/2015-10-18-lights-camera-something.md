For some time now I've wanted to get a camera. A dedicated camera instead of the camera on my phone, because every time I sit down to choose photos for my journal entries I find myself disappointed with the photos I have.

Sure some of them are okay but too often I find myself pushing up against what the LG G3 camera can do.

Let's just look at the specifications.

The LG 3G has a 13MP sensor with a laser-assisted autofocus, dual-LED flash and OIS+, a combination of optical and electronic stabilization.

And that's it. It's not really bad but it's not good enough any more either.

Chase is of course right, but I want something better than what I have, that I can then have with me.

So I begun researching, reading and bothering all my camera-enthusiastic friends for suggestions.

After a while I had narrowed down my search to Canon, I'm used to Canon cameras from before, and a few of their models.

The Canon 5D Mark I, a professional level full-frame <abbr title="digital single-lens reflex camera" class="small-caps">DSLR</abbr>; Canon EOS M, an upper-entry level crop-frame <abbr title="mirrorless interchangeable lens camera" class="small-caps">MILC</abbr> and Canon 600D, an upper-entry level crop-frame <abbr class="small-caps">DSLR</abbr>.

I recently got the opportunity to play around with the 5D and the 600D and whilst I certainly liked both of them, especially the 600D, neither of them "felt right".

So I kept researching and bothering my friends and it wasn't until a few weeks ago when I went down to the beach for a friends birthday celebration that I finally found a camera that I instantly fell in love with.

The Canon EOS 100D, an upper-entry level crop-frame <abbr class="small-caps">DSLR</abbr> described as the "world's smallest and lightest DSLR camera" feels very similar to the 600D but with an upgraded DIGIC 5 image processor instead of DIGIC 4 and is a substantially 157g lighter.

The 100D has a <abbr title="Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor" class="small-caps">CMOS</abbr> <abbr title="Advanced Photo System type-C" class="small-caps">APS-C</abbr> 22.3 x 14.9 mm (1.6x crop factor) sensor, 9 point Hybrid CMOS AF II and a E-TTL II automatic built-in pop-up flash.

I ordered the camera and the EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens it came with the other day.

And it arrived a few minutes ago.

Aside for that I should now be able to get much better photos in my journal it also means the aspect ratio on my photos are going to change, from <code>16:9</code> to <code>3:2</code> which I'm more excited about than any man should be.

Stay tuned for better photos.

*I thought it would be ironic if an entry about cameras and photography didn't contain a single photo.*
