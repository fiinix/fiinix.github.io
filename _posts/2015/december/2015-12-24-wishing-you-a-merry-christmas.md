Preparing for Christmas is always a time of mixed emotions; Between the excitement and presents to the excruciating shopping and stressing oneself to an early grave, it's easy to see why some people would rather not celebrate it at all.

I don't blame them. Fuck, not a year goes by when I'm not tempted to join them.

But I really shouldn't complain. So I won't. Instead I will make a gingerbread cookie dough that been handed down from my mom---thought I've tweaked it substantially since---and bake some gingerbread cookies with Lucien, who had been looking forward to it.

Baking the gingerbread cookies was of course only a small part in the Christmas feast. Other delicious things on the menu included a large roasted goose---we've always wanted to try goose---freshly baked bread, roasted vegetables and Rebecka's delightful re-invention of the British Christmas Pudding---the secret is that doesn't contain any fruits or raisins.

Once everyone---and the food---was ready, it was time to finally sit down and enjoy our Christmas feast.

Now, we've eaten the food, opened the presents and started boiling the goose carcass into a broth for soup another day---waste not, want not---I can relax a little again.

And after all of this, in an effort to keep this entry short---I want you to get to go back to your Christmas celebrations as well, after all---the only thing left to do; From all of us, to all of you, a very Merry Christmas.
