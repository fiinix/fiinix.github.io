Dear 2015,

I don't really know how to start this so I'll just get right to the point; It's not you, it's me. And by that I mean, it's you.

Phew, I feel so much better now that that's out of the way.

But I suppose I owe you an explanation.

I mean, after all, we had a good run.

It wasn't all bad.

You were a bit impatient at times, running at a pace I had trouble keeping up with and I tried to see past it but in the end I feel like there just wasn't enough time for us.

At first we were both pretty excited and [looking forward to all the things][forward] we would do together, like going to France---but that's unlikely to happen any time soon---or all the crisp bread we were going to bake together.

I mean we certainly did *some* things together. But was it enough? This letter says, "No."

Where's my crisp bread?

<p data-pullquote="Don’t tell me you’re surprised. You really should have seen this coming."></p>

Hey, no, don't do that.

Don't cry.

We had some good times too, remember that time [we pretened it was 1943 for a month?][wartime] Yeah, that was strange and interesting.

You even encouraged me [to get new glasses][glasses] and when I had my doubts you took your time, calmed me down and ensured that I was confident about my choice before buying them. I think we're both happy with the end result.

But here's the thing. We all change. Well, *I've changed* at least. I'm not the man I once was. And it's for the better. Well, for me anyway.

Don't tell me you're surprised. You *really* should have seen this coming. Between me spending half our time together [getting a sleeve tattoo][tattoo] and the other half [exercising and becoming healthier][puking], I've been growing a lot in this past year.

Not to mention, doing [public speaking][speaking] and becoming a [published writer in net magazine][writing]. I just feel like I've changed a lot and you haven't.

Well that's not entirely true, you've gotten older, which I don't mind, but that hardly seems like an accomplishment.

> There is nothing permanent except change. <cite>Heraclitus</cite>

And I would say, "We'll always have Paris," but... well... you know.

Instead, we'll always have that time [I dressed up like Hitler][beard], which is perhaps not quite the *city of love* but more like the *alley of offensiveness*.

Now I'm sure you're thinking, "This is why he didn't give me a Christmas present, he knew he was breaking up with me," but let me assure you that it isn't why.

I didn't get you a Christmas present because I bought myself an Xbox One instead.

And before you ask, no I'm not seeing anyone new. I know you stopped by the other day and things got a little awkward with you and Twenty-Sixteen but I promise you nothing is going on with him.

We're just friends.

But, ummm, please don't show up unannounced like that again because of, unrelated reasons.

P.S. I still want my favourite shirt back but you don't have to wash it. Oh right, and a Happy New Year.
