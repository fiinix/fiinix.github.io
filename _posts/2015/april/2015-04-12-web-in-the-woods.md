Announcement time!

Later this year, on September the 12th---5 months from now---I'm going to be one of the five main speakers at [Web in the Woods][web], a delightful conference with a campfire.

I've been thinking about and wanting to give back to the web community ever since I attended my first conference Front-End London, back in March two years ago and got to talking to one of the speakers afterwards.

Joining [Lucie De Lacy][lucie], [Dan Edwards][dan], [Sally Jenkinson][sally] and [Paul Adam Davis][paul] as well as five on-the-spot lightning speakers, I hope to inspire people---much like other people have inspired me---with my talk.

Titled **Money = Accessibility**, I aim to demonstrate how ignoring accessibility is actually costing you, and your business in lost revenue.

So if you're feeling up for an inspirational conference where instead of crowding a noisy pub, you can enjoy the crackling of burning wood and perhaps some s'mores afterwards, then [get yourself a ticket][event] and I'll see you by the campfire.
