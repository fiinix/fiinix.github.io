In Sweden and parts of Finland, rather than just pay our respects to the death and resurrection of our Lord and Saviour Jeeby Creeby, we have managed to hold on to old pagan traditions as well---what else?

I suppose it's only natural since moving to the <abbr title="United Kingdom" class="small-caps">UK</abbr>, that passing these traditions along have become more important.

Before Jeeby Creeby showed up and ruined everything with his holier than thou, "I'm the son of God, blah blah," Easter was a time for some good old pagan fun. It was a time for witches to fly off on broomsticks to dance with the devil at <i lang="sv">Blåkulla</i> (Blue Hill).

A time where children, both girls and boys, dressed up as <i lang="sv">påskkärringar</i> (Easter Hags), painted their faces, carried a broomstick---or perhaps a copper pot---and walked around the neighbourhood knocking on peoples' doors for treats, similar to Halloween here in the <abbr class="small-caps">UK</abbr>.

So, in preserving traditions, what is one to do?

And lamb on Sunday. Everyone's happy.
