Another month flies by where the English weather can't seem to decide if it's going to be summer or not, with one day of 20&deg; in blistering sunshine and the next it's just pissing down.

##Tattoo session \#6 & 7

I'm sure you're quite tired of hearing about my tattoo at this point. Which is why I'm happy to tell you it's done. <i lang="fr">C'est fait</i>. Finally, right?

Since April last year, back in [Getting Inked Again][inked], when I first mentioned getting a sleeve tattoo to cover my right arm, to where I am now, has taken a little over a year to complete.

From those first sketches in April, it took 4 months before I got the first session done and another 5 months for the second session. After that though, they were a bit more frequent as I got around to getting myself inked about once every month.

Until finally, this month, when I went twice and got it finished.

The last parts are still healing and I'm still figuring out how to actually take a decent picture of it, which is why the above will have to suffice for now.

##6 month beard

A couple of weeks ago I reached the halfway mark on my stupid beard journey---in which I grow out my beard and hair for an entire year---and to celebrate I had another moment of, "Should I really continue with this?"

The answer is, "Yes."

I know I said I was going to trim and groom my beard, to not let it take over our lives but to be honest, I have idea what I'm doing.

After 6 months, I now have---sort of---a beard but no clue how to make it look nice and tidy. Oh, the first world problems some of us have.

I've trimmed the moustache twice but I still feel woefully uninformed about what I should and shouldn't be doing.

So, I suspect I'm going to have to do some research, maybe even buy some equipment like a good trimmer.

If you're not already, you can follow my stupid journey in [A Scary, Hairy Beard Story][beard], where I update every Sunday.

##Back to the Comic Con

Our little group once again returned to MCM Comic Con, which had, a record breaking, more than 122,000 visitors this time.

Last time I had wanted to take more interesting pictures, which I---in hindsight---feel I accomplished adequately. This time, I wanted to take less pictures and really enjoy the experience of being there instead and judging by the few decent pictures I have one can only assume---feel free to assume---that I accomplished it... adequately.

In anticipation of the upcoming Batman: Arkham Knight game, [I had planned on dressing up as Scarecrow][new-year] but this went as plans sometimes go, <i lang="gd">agley</i>, and in the end neither I, or anyone of our group, dressed up.

Which is a shame, as [John Noble][imdb-john]---the voice actor for Scarecrow in said upcoming game---was attending Comic Con and I would have loved to see him. He played Walter Bishop in the TV series Fringe, which is still one of my favourite <abbr title="science fiction">sci-fi</abbr> series of all time.

At least I got see the Batmobile based on, again, said upcoming game.

A celebrity I did manage to see up close thought was [Karl Yune][imdb-karl], who portrays Maseo Yamashiro on CW's Arrow, as he casually strolled past us carrying a take-away bag of food.

	<figcaption>This is apparently how Kratos smiles.</figcaption>

Of course, no Comic Con would be complete without a plushie for Lucien. And since he's still really into Pokémon I figured I would continue his modest collection and got him [Chikorita][pokemon], a Grass-type Pokémon, this time.

<figure>

So, with so little pictures to show for, what was the highlight of this year's Comic Con?

This.

Fox and Christopher Lloyd.">
	<figcaption>Another thing I can check off the bucket list.</figcaption>
</figure>

To my disappointment I missed [Christopher Lloyd][imdb-chris], Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brow, who had been there earlier in the morning. Still though. That's me, in the DeLorean.

##Drinking better beer

As some of you might know, I've been exploring the wonderful world of beers--though often ales---ever since my brother Christian introduced me to Shepherd Neame's Spitfire, an award-winning Kentish ale, that I didn't particularly like.

But what it did was open up my eyes---mouth?---to that beer can be about more than just getting drunk.

<p data-pullquote="Their simple goal of “Drink better beer” is one I can whole-heartedly get behind."></p>

Since then I've always strived to embrace every opportunity to try different ales, keeping a spreadsheet---who doesn't?---of my thoughts and notes, which can sometimes be as simple as, "Meh".

And one thing I've wanted to try since moving to the <abbr title="United Kingdom" class="small-caps">UK</abbr>, is a subscription beer company---something which wouldn't be legally possible in Finland---called [Beerbods][beer].

	<figcaption>The first beer, Lymestone’s Ein Stein, was not my kind of beer but I still enjoyed the experience.</figcaption>
</figure>

Which is why I now have 12---11 at the time of writing---weeks worth of beers and look forward to trying them all.

And that's it for this month.
