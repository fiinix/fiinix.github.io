I'm sure you've been asking yourself, "Is he going to write a stupid entry about Eurovision this year again?"

I'm happy to tell you that your deepest fears have been answered because, "Yes. Yes I am."

You know how I thought that [last year was the Year of the Ballad][previously]. As it turns out, I was wrong because *every year*, is the Year of the Ballad.

So here we are, I have once again pushed myself and endured through the hardship that is listening to music I don't particularly like to present you with another round in the epic battle that is "Finland vs. United Kingdom, a rivalry that I've completely made up."

Now I know that the Eurovision is split into two Semi-Finals followed by the Grand Final, which means that some of the ones I've liked might not even make it to the Grand Final but that's just a risk I'm going to have to take.

So, having said all of that, let's get on with the show.

First up, in 10th place...

## United Kingdom

[Electro Velvet and their Still In Love With You][uk] manages to sway me---but barely---getting them 1 measly point, but will it be enough for <abbr title="United Kingdom" class="small-caps">UK</abbr> to win the rivalry---that I've made up---between them and Finland?

Despite its negative reception, I actually think it's an okay song. Both singers are incredible dull but at least the song itself is not as boring as some of their previous contenders.

## F.Y.R. Macedonia
[Daniel Kajmakoski and his Autumn Leaves][macedonia] starts out as your everyday bland piano ballad and well, picks up a little as it reaches the pre-chorus but never really becomes anything more than a so-so piano ballad. Still, it's better than many other so well done, I suppose, Macedonia here's your 2 points.

## Czech Republic

[Marta Jandová and Václav Noid Bárta and their Hope Never Dies][czech] gets my 3 points. Sure, Marta is decent but what seals the deal is Václav, the tattooed bear-man with diastema, and his glorious voice.

## Switzerland

[Mélanie René with her Time To Shine][switzerland] gets my 4 points. Is it a great song? Not really, but I like it. It's catchy, quite good and Mélanie sings it well.

## Latvia

[Aminata sings Love Injected][latvia] and gets 5 points for her troubles. This is the first song that I'm---sort of---genuinely liking a bit. Yeah, I'm sorry <abbr class="small-caps">UK</abbr> but your song just wasn't good enough. Aminata has an excellent voice that carries this song far.

## Iceland

[Maria Olafs is Unbroken][iceland] in an abandoned factory. This one reminds me of Denmark's winner a couple of years ago. But then again I suppose any barefooted Scandinavian girl will have that effect on me. *As far as I'm concerned Iceland, you're totally a part of Scandinavia*. Here's your 6 points.

## Azerbaijan

[Elnur Huseynov and his Hour Of The Wolf][azerbaijan] swoops in and captures 7 points. Elnur and his falsetto extraordinare shines at the crescendo and I feel compelled to actually listen to it again.

Now, before we move on to the top 3, we should stop to take a moment and pay our respects to all our fallen comrades. Let's take a moment of silence for all those who didn't make it this far.

Some of you were so close, like Georgia's contender [Nina Sublatti and her Warrior][georgia] and Armenia's [Genealogy with Face The Shadow][armenia].

Others, were not really close at all, with their super-annoying and repetitive shit-songs, like Lithuania's [Monika Linkyt and Vaidas Baumila and their This Time][lithuania], making me want to Vincent Van Gogh myself.

Then, of course, there's that *epic* rivalry I keep going on about. Is perhaps Finland's [Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät and their Aina Mun Pitää][finland] in the top 3 this year? Is that why I haven't mentioned them yet?

The answer is---spoiler alert!---a disappointing, "No. No, they're not."

Now, I could go on about the band itself and how it represents a step forward for Finland as a country and Eurovision Song Contest as an event. A step towards being more inclusive, which is good and about time and whilst it's a small step, it's a step nonetheless.

But here's the thing; I didn't like the song. I just didn't. And for that reason I haven't given them any points.

Which means, the <abbr class="small-caps">UK</abbr> wins this round and gets a point, putting them in the lead.

Moving onwards though, in third place:

## Estonia

[Elina Born & Stig Rästa with their Goodbye To Yesterday][estonia] gets a well earned 8 points. A good and catchy song with a duo that complement each other great.

In second place:

## Italy

[Il Volo sings about a Grande Amore][italy] and aside for the, "Great Love," part I don't understand a word of it. But you know what? I don't care 'cos it's awesome. Here's 10 points Italy, for your adorable boy-children with their beautiful voices.

Which means we have now reached the ending, the final 12 points. Who will receive the famous Douze?

*Drum roll please*.

This year's Eurovision winner--according to a stranger on the internet that doesn't actually follow Eurovision *that much*---is...

## Norway

[Mørland & Debrah Scarlett sing A Monster Like Me][norway] and it's haunting. Their voices harmonise in a way that gives me goosebumps. The song manages to be both creepy and beautiful all in one go.

This Saturday, the 23rd, we'll see how all of this pans out---was my opinion near those of the publics' votes---and more importantly we get to see how the <abbr class="small-caps">UK</abbr> fares against Finland.

If the <abbr class="small-caps">UK</abbr> does better than Finland in the competition I can give them another point---under my arbitrary rules---and with a 2 point lead that also means I can put this pretend rivalry to rest.

We'll see. Or hear? Yeah, we'll hear.
