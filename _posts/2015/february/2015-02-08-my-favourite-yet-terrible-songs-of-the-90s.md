excerpt: "In which I admit to liking some questionable songs from the ‘90s."

When I first thought of the entry idea to write a list of ‘90s songs, the most obvious choice was to write about my favourite songs, picking one song per year.

But as I started listening to the songs, it dawned on me what a boring list this would become. My taste in music is hardly unique---as far as the ‘90s goes---and unsurprisingly, I found myself thinking the songs were genuinely good.

So, new plan.

Instead of just writing about songs we can all agree are genuinely good, classics that have stood the test of time, I want to focus on the songs I'm a little bit embarrassed to admit that I like. I, of course, still like them but I'd rather do it in secrecy where your judgemental stares can't find me.

Oh, stop looking at me like that.

And for good measure, I'll also include those good songs that I genuinely like, in a discernible pattern of embarrassing, good, embarrassing, good, etc.

Anyway, here we go.

*For your listening pleasure, I've put them all in one giant playlist.*
