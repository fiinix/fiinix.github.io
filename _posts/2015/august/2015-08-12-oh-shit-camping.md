*I'm still on my writing holiday which is why I'm going to keep this as short as possible.*

Back when I announced that I'm speaking at my first conference I had plenty of time before the actual conference was taking place.

Well, 5 months has quickly turned into 1 month and on September the 12th I'm going to be one of the five main speakers at [Web in the Woods][web], a delightful conference with a campfire.

Today is the day I realise that I don't have a tent. Or a sleeping bag. Or anything of the bare essentials one needs to survive outdoors--granted it's just for a weekend but still.

I might have to look into all of this very soon.

I'm sure I'll get it fixed by the 12th of September, I mean, it's a *whole* month until then.

Join us, there's a great line-up of [Lucie De Lacy][lucie], [Dan Edwards][dan], [Sally Jenkinson][sally], [Paul Adam Davis][paul] and of course, yours truly speaking about different awesome things.

My talk is titled **Accessibility = Money**, where I aim to demonstrate how ignoring accessibility is actually costing you, and your business in lost revenue.

Come and enjoy the crackling of burning wood and perhaps some s'mores, by [getting yourself a ticket to Web in the Woods][event] and I'll see you by the campfire.
