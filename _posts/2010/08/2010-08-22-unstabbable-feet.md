excerpt: "In which I write a song without a deep hidden meaning."

No metaphors, no deep hidden meanings of cynicism and/or self-pity.

Enjoy this newly written previously unreleased very, and I repeat VERY rough demo of Unstabbable Feet. Why? You ask. Because sometimes you should have to relax a little and have some fun.  
A big thank you to my sources of inspiration; my son for trying to stab his mother with a wooden spatula and my dear friend Beije for complaining that I never have any songs that are happy.

This one is probably not happy enough anyway but at least I gave it a shot, for now.
