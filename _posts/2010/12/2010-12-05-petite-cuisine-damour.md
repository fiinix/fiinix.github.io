Aaah. It's done, and for a being the first of possibly more books, I am actually quite pleased with the result. Yeah sure, I cheated here and there, because, well.. I can.. but I'm still pleased with it.

Here's some process pictures of the making of the book. I don't really know if anyone else likes process pictures but I'm a big fan of how to make shit. Sorry for the inferior quality but you know, camera phone and bad lighting isn't a very good combination. I touched them up using Adobe Photoshop but "shit in.. shit out..".

And for your viewing pleasure. Here's the final book! Yeah, I'm very certain that the title is all kinds of wrong, but I feel it looks better this way. Feel free to judge according to your own taste.
