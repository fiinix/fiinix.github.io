Hello again.. or something..  
Inspired by thinking about random things I just remembered (and by just I mean several hours ago) that about a year and a half ago I actually built an eight-person poker table. This project was not done on my own though as I was serving my civil duty under KÃ¥rkulla at the moment, and supervising their wood working department or something like that I suppose. We had done different kinds of stuff to sell and were a bit out of ideas at the time, I asked my supervisor what we should do next? And then she did the "mistake" like many others have done in the past, she said; "Just come up with something.."

---Muahahaha!

Nah, but all jokes aside. I love being told to come up with something, it's how I work best. Anyways. So I thought, Hey, I have almost zero experience with wood crafting, not the best tools available but a wild imagination. What to do? Oh, I'll build an octagonal poker table for 8 people. As side reference I can tell you, that I'm actually not entirely sure how you play Texas Hold 'Em, normal poker I can do, but not Texas Hold 'Em. So I asked them if that was okay, and strangely it was.

Construction-wise I would think it's quite poor, not in that it's badly made, but just since I had/have no experience or knowledge regarding wood crafting I didn't really know what one should think about when designing a table sturdy enough to support the evenly distributed weight of 8 grown men. Do you see where I'm going with this? The legs were constructed out of [European Spruce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picea_abies) at first. Anyone with enough experience is probably laughing their brains out right now, thinking (with a snobby French accent) "Ha, anyyy'one whith half a brain would know not to u'uuse that". Well I didn't, but I do now. Needless to say, I leaned on the table, heard a loud crack as the legs broke completely. They were re-constructed out of [Birch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch) wood, when I found out that interior furniture are better made from Birch wood.

Design-wise I feel very pleased with my p-p-p-poker table. I simply think it's stunningly beautiful. Feel free to disagree and send me an email at <BlowItUpYour@ss.com>.

Now, enough talk (write). Enjoy the slideshow I made especially for you. Oh yeah.. sli'iiideshow.

*Because of content migration, the slideshow no longer exists and I couldn't find the source photos.*
