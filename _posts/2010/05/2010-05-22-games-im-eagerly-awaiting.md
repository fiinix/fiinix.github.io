excerpt: "In which I talk about some games I'm really looking forward to."
---
There are a number of games (Xbox 360) I'm waiting for... Not that you probably care.. but instead of writing it down on piece of paper that I will inevitable misplace resulting in that I forget one game, is not something I desire. So I will write it down here and I can just refer to this page, maybe even review the games after they have been released. I probably won't review them but one (I) can always do some wishful thinking. Also for the sake of not just vaguely talking about games you might not have heard of. I am also going to honour you with their teaser/trailers..

So without further ado, here we go in no particular order, because let's face it. I'm eager for all of these.

## Fable III (Lionhead Studios)

Why am I looking forward to this? Because despite Peter's promises before the release of Fable (one) and the two following Fable games. He promised amongst other things, "plant an acorn, later a tree will grow". Anyways, point being, Peter promised a lot of things that never came to fruition. But I you for a second forget about that and play Fable and take it for what it is, it's a very good game. I liked Fable... I liked Fable: The Lost Chapters... I liked Fable II... And I think I am going to like Fable III. Plus points go to Lionhead Studios goes for making a game that me and my wife to be could both play and enjoy, albeit we liked it for somewhat different reasons. Which is actually more impressive. On a side note, it's worth mentioning that the wife to be is NOT a self proclaimed gamer, she enjoys The Sims and that's about it.

## Halo: Reach (Bungie)

Why am I looking forward to this? A love affair that started randomly, Halo has a special place in my heart. Not because of all the long nights playing LAN with friends, organizing LAN events just to play Halo. No those are all nice, but that comes after the one-night stand that started it all. Let's go back a few years, to the summer of 2002 (I think). Getting wasted with a friend we decided to walk to his place (a couple of km's) to play some Xbox, I'm pretty much sure we never meant to play Halo: Combat Evolved. Anyways, my friend was so drunk he just fell asleep the second we got there. So I put Halo in, and to this day I can still remember the sheer panic of trying to get out of Pillar of Autumn before she blows. And then finally landing in the sprawling landscape of a Halo ring. I was hooked. Fast forward eight years, do I still like Halo? Yes. Was Halo the first Bungie game I played? No, Oni was my first. I've already finished the fight, now I just want to tie up all possible loose ends by getting the story from the beginning. Bungie's final Halo installment to us. Halo: Reach.

## Fallout: New Vegas (Obsidian Entertainment)

Why am I looking forward to this? The music, the atmosphere. I just love walking around the Wasteland, shooting people whilst listening to music I love. Bethesda made a great Fallout 3. But with some of the original creators of the Fallout series I am even more eager. Fallout: New Vegas will, mark my words, be awesome! I hope.

## Batman: Arkham Asylum 2 (Rocksteady Studios)

Why am I looking forward to this? In the history of games, there are two games (ever!) that have managed to be not just good, but great Superhero Games. One of them is Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Buther Bay. The other one is Batman: Arkham Asylum, released last year. Batman was awesome! Fuck Yeah! Mark Hamill as the Joker, Kevin Conroy as Batman and it was actually quite gritty (I hate that word, but it's true). Rocksteady has some work to do, if they want to get Batman 2 better than the first one. Rocksteady, I have faith in you. You have proven to me that you understand the core of the Batman mythology/history.

Now, make me proud.

Eagerness level: *5 stiff bat-penises out of 5*

So there we go. Four games I'm looking forward too, some more than others maybe. But I am eagerly awaiting them nonetheless. Are there any games I've missed that you think I should be looking forward to as well? Go right ahead and comment, I am willing to expand my horizons. But for now, we're only counting games that have been announced. Okay?
