It didn't get better.

*As I'm sure you're all well-aware, I didn't run the London Marathon this year.*

After going for another short run, to assess my recovery, it became painfully obvious that my knee still hasn't recovered enough.

The pain wasn't as severe as a few months ago, but it was enough to that the idea of running 42 km (26 miles) seemed like a bad idea.

I wasn't the only one who was worried, a few close friends also began doubting whether I would be able to run the marathon.

About a week before the London Marathon, after talking to EAAA, we decided to defer my marathon place for next year giving me more time to recover, train and fundraise.

I was really disappointed.

I felt like I had failed <abbr title="East Anglian Air Ambulance" class="small-caps">EAAA</abbr>, myself and all of you who had already donated to support my journey to the London Marathon.

I felt like I had failed myself.

Not only that, but by deferring my place until next year I missed so many once-in-a-lifetime experiences.

Like [Mo Farah breaking the British record time][farah] in elite men's race.

The Queen pushing a big red button to sound the klaxxon.

Or the [woman who got engaged to a dinosaur][dinosaur] during the marathon.

But it couldn't be helped.

Sometimes injuries happen and judging from what my physiotherapist discovered, it's surprising that I hadn't sustained injuries earlier than I did.

In hindsight, I should listen to my body more.

In hindsight, I could have probably prevented the extent of this.

I should warm-up properly before going for a run.

Let this be a lesson Future Carlos, you are not invincible.

And if you already unashamed about wearing tight compression shorts when you're running---which I know you are---then a little dynamic stretching or jogging the first few miles isn't going to kill you.

After all, it's a marathon, not a sprint.
