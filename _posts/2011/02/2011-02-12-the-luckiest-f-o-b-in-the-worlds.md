**Surprise bitches!**
  
By the way, F.O.B is my own invention, feel free to steal it.. Father Of a Bastard.. but in a none insulting way, more like a "lovingly Old English my son is a bastard child.. because we weren't married". But we and therefore I am married now, so hurray to me. I couldn't be happier unless it was also Valentine's Day on Monday... oh it is? Then awesome!
