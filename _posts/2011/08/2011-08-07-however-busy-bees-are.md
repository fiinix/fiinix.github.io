excerpt: "In which I'm really busy doing lots of different things."
---
..is how busy I am right now. So much to do but also actually some time to do it too. Starting Monday I plan on fully enjoying my well earned 4 week vacation, which just means more time to do stuff I probably won't get paid for.. but that's okay, I truly enjoy creating something out of nothing.. with my hands and what have we.

Yeah, I'm still going to try my best to blog more and I'm sure it'll get better again once I have managed to get some stuff out of the way (read: do them). For now.. this will have to do.

For some reason I have started baking a lot more lately, I'm not entirely sure why yet but at least the familia is not complaining about my cookies and cakes.

Anyway. As soon as I have a little more time on my hands, that I would rather not spend creating I 'll write some more stuff of no particular interest. My cold-brewing is still going nicely thanks for asking and I'm almost exclusively drinking Iced Coffee nowadays. Still trying to improve my brewing technique though as I feel it could be even better.
