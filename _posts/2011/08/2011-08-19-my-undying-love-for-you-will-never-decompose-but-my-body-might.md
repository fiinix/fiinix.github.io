Drumroll and then some huge applause for my good friend [beije](http://benjaminhorn.io), who so graciously not only filmed one of my [performances](/blog/under-the-weather) but also colour corrected and edited it. Awesome!

I semi-proudly hereby present my first public performance of "My Undying Love For You Will Never Decompose (But My Body Might)", a song I started writing several months ago but didn't actually really finish until the night before I performed it. In case you're wondering the talking in the beginning part of the video is just me explaining how this song is a little "outside the box" but that it's still a love song.. or something like that.

The audio quality isn't very awesome, but definitely on par with my performance two years ago (youtube channel link [here](http://www.youtube.com/youtubablecarlos)) so I'm not complaining. The visual quality on the other hand is light-years ahead of my last video and one can clearly distinguish my sweaty face. So yeah, enjoy that!
