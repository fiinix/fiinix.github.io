As some of you might already know, via other sources, all of the T-Shirts are now available for sale.

Yeah I know, it's totally awesome!

So here's is now the list of all of 'em, since I noticed they seemed to be a bit tricky to find through shotdeadinthehead.com's search. I figured instead of making you frustrated in maybe not finding them all, you could just use this nice reference list. That way, if I ever get more merchandise I could probably list them here too, and back link to this post. Or something. I don't really know yet. But I will link to this post from my soon to be released website (new design, new colours and all).

Yeah, you read it. I invented some new colours so that I would be able to have colours that no-one has ever seen before.  

Okay, I'm done being sarcastic now.

Feel free to "browse" the T-Shirts and if you happen to actually buy one, do totally send me a picture of you wearing it and maybe I can make a thing out it, like a post called "Fans of Carlos" or something where I post the pictures. Or not.
