Make trends.. or follow. Or like in this case, just another obligatory Happy Easter. But with a usual Carlosian (yeah, it's gonna become a thing) twist. Well, a twist might be a bit of an overstatement, less of an M.Night Shamailaiööön type twist (Shyamalan according to Google).. and more like "I'm calling you a bitch whilst.." -twist. So without further ado I present with this years Easter greetings, twist and all!

Yeah, the second picture isn't even Easter related, it's just a random picture taken of our living room whilst lying in bed. At least the first picture contains objects relevant to Easter, not so much the Jesus-y kind of Easter, more the eating of chocolate and decorating of [Pussy Willow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy_Willow). Best part.. I totally did not just make up the Pussy Willow -part, apparently it is actually called that in English. It's true what They (who?) sometimes say, fact is funnier than fiction. Behold the proof that is Pussy Willow.. Pussy Willow..

Pussy Willow..

Okay, so it's not that funny. But it's still a little funny..

> Anyway, Happy Easter Bitches!
