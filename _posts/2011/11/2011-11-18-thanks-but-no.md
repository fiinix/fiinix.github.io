So yeah. I didn't make it through. That's that, I going to blog more about maybe tomorrow or something but right now I actually don't have the time to blog about it. But there's stories to share, and I will share them, I promise you that much..
  
I sang Accidents Can Happen by Sixx A.M. for those who are interested. <del>I would embed it, but it was disabled for the official video so this one will have to do.</del> But stay tuned for more stories and pictures.
