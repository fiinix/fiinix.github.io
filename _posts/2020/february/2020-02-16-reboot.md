excerpt: "In which I begin rebooting this site."

Back in 2014, [I designed this site in the open][home]. Worts and all, every mistake was live the day I made them. From search forms without styles to watercolour experiments that didn't pan out, it was a truly iterative process of designing in the open and I loved every messy minute of it.

What I didn't do, however, was document anything. None of my thoughts, decisions or purposeful omissions was written down.

If you asked me why I did anything now, I wouldn't remember it anymore.

So that's what I'm doing differently this time.

Starting today, entries related to the redesign will begin with “Reboot:” to distinguish them from the rest of my journal. This entry will act as a table of contents.

*Expect entries to be focussed on a single problem as much as possible and with little copy-editing.*
