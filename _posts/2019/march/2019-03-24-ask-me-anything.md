[/r/IAmA][reddit] is a subreddit for question-and-answer interactive interviews called Ask Me Anything (AMA).

With a wide range of interviews, they have ranged from celebrities to everyday people in different lines of work. Since its founding in May 2009, AMA has become one of Reddit's most popular communities.

In celebration of ten years of /r/IAmA, I thought it fitting to see what it would be like to own version of it.

Now, I'm no Neil deGrasse Tyson or Madonna, both of which have done their own AMA on Reddit but I am me, which makes me uniquely qualified to answer questions about me.

Here's how you can participate: Tweet your questions [@fiinixdesign][tweet], comment on any other social media platforms or just ask me, straight to my face.

As and if I receive questions, I'll update this entry with the questions credited to you---unless you want to be anonymous.

Here we go.

I'm Carlos Eriksson. A published writer, occasional speaker, runner, story-teller, and currently Inclusive design lead at Studio 24 where I'm making the places you can visit from a computer better for everyone, not just the people itâ€™s easy for. And teaching other people how to do the same.

And you can ask me anything.
