Every conceivable muscle is pulsating and my legs are screaming for an end to their suffering. My breath is shallow and strained as I steer to the side of the road to crouch down---*in yoga, we call that the child pose.*

I've just passed the 23 km (14 miles) mark and I still have 19 km (12 miles) to go.

Just over halfway, I've hit the infamous wall.

*The wall (noun): A condition of sudden fatigue and loss of energy which is caused by the depletion of glycogen stores in the liver and muscles.*

I'm ready to give up.

What began as a strong start has turned sour---*like my smelly feet.*

"Why do I do this to myself?"

***

*After much consideration, I have decided to not run for EAAA in next year's London Marathon. I appreciate all the support and help you've given me along the way. I have reassessed my health, both physical and mental I realised that I'm not a place to complete it.*

Last October I pressed send and released a sigh of relief realising I now had no obligations to run.

Now, the only person I ran for was myself.

I had gotten caught, as I’m sure many other runners do, in the excitement and grandeur of the big events. In the crowds cheering. And the medals and goodie-bags that followed.

<p data-pullquote="“It better not be shit, again.”"></p>

But now I knew better.

Three days later my phone pinged as an email arrived in the inbox, "Congratulations! You are now registered for the Brighton Marathon 2019."

*Say what you will about Carlos, but he sure doesn't know better for long.*

Still recovering from the knee injury, I told no one about my new plans to run a marathon.

Partly so people wouldn't worry and partly so I wouldn't have to explain myself; If running had caused the knee injury in the first place then the only logical solution was to not run.

And with that, I made "not running" my plan.

***

My breathing is returning to its normal depth.

I get back up and hobble along until I reach the 30 km (18 miles) medical point where a group of concerned volunteers hand me a space blanket and ask me repeatedly if I want to lie down.

The cold breeze of the English Channel paired with my hobbling has cooled me down considerably and I can barely move my legs at this point.

I decline their offer and instead crouch down next to their tent in front of the intermittently warming sun, wrapping myself in the bright luminous foil.

"Maybe not training for a marathon wasn't such a good idea?"

I watch as people run past, some still have a lightness in their step whilst others are dragging their crying skeletons along just like me.

"Is this where I end?" I think, taking the opportunity to let out the fart I've been holding for the past 30 minutes, "It better not be shit, again."

It isn't.

I get up.

Asking the volunteers if I can keep the space blanket, I return to the race course and start running again.

"Go, Tinman, go," a kid shouts as a loud rustling swooshes past him.

And I keep going.

Despite not running for 5 months.

Despite having no hydration, refuelling or really any plan to speak of.

Despite running in a new pair of shoes I bought the week before.

In the end, my newfound vigour is only temporary and I'm back to hobbling for the last 4 km (2.5 miles) but with that hobbling, I cross the finish line.

Despite what [my inconclusive race results say][results].

"Never again. I'm done running now."

## What I learned from running a marathon

As an experienced runner will attest to, there are [a few basic rules][golden] that you're advised to follow whilst running, even more so when running a major event.

These are not those rules.

1. Running a marathon is hard
2. No really, harder than you think
3. 1% of the population will run a marathon in their lifetime. I am now one of them.
4. If I were you, I probably wouldn't use myself as an example of what to do
5. I can run a fucking marathon
6. Always poop before running

I wake up the next morning, having to lift my leg one-by-one from the bed onto the floor.

My toes feel like they have extra toes and stairs have become my nemesis.

Despite this, a thought stirs in my mind.

"I can do better next time."
