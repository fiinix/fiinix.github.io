In which I take you step-by-step of the making of my new online class: where I teach inclusive user experience design.

When Skillshare approached me back in February to collaborate together to create a Skillshare Original I was both honoured and intriguied.

Coindidently I had been thinking about expanding my blaghdsv and a priority on my list was teaching.

> Skillshare is an online learning community of over 7 million students.

It was clear from the start, if I was going to teach anything, it would be about accessibility and inclusive design, i.e. making websites better for everone, not just the people it's easy for.

And because I've been thinking about teaching for a while now, I already had a list of topics I could talk about. Specific topics, where I had focussed it to a single story with a single lesson.

After a couple of discussion with jessica, one of Skillshare's community managers, we narrowed down these 64 topics, to a group of 9-10 topics I would talk about.

These would all be centerd around people with various forms of disabilities and the mismatch between technology and the people using it. With realworld statistics to illustrate how many millions of people are affected by our design choices. backed up by solid data

We now had a plan and an outline.

It was time for me to fill the gaps in my data by researching and start writing the lessons.

After about 40 hours of research and 15 hours of writing I had segnkflgnslfg it was finally time to record the lessons.

- recording experience
- struggling to pronounce simple words such as "lost", and complicated words such as "deuteranomaly"
- 8-10 minutes per lessson, which results 2 min

Afte editing, tidying up


We finally arrive at today, where after months of writing, recording and producing I'm tickled to announce;

*How to design inclusive user experiences (UX) for people*, over a decade of knowledge and experience packed into a 30-minute class, where you get to know some of the real people you're excluding and practical tips how to fix it. A class that you can return to over and over again.
