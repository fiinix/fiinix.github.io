A year ago I sat and wrote down a list of things I wanted to accomplish last year.

But that's all well and good.

Sometimes, life doesn't go as planned.

But that doesn't have to be a bad thing.

I want to be the kind of person who welcomes the surprises as much as I welcome the plans.

What follows is a review of all the things I had no plans of doing but managed to do anyway.

## Self-care

I have difficulties justifying taking care of myself even though I know I should. Little rituals that don't make me feel like I'm depriving someone else of something works quite well.

### Fresh coffee

After I managed to quit smoking---again---it was only a matter of time before I started treating myself to freshly ground coffee---again.

I've [talked plenty about it before][coffee] so won't do it again but needless to say, this is probably the one vice I will never give up.

Having those few but spectacular cups of coffee every morning sets the tone for the entire rest of the day and it's a symphony I always enjoy.

### Meal planning and weekly shopping

I never imagined meal planning would reduce the cognitive load as much as it did.

Thinking about what we're going to eat and what we need to buy only once a week might just be my favourite new thing I didn't plan on doing but did anyway.

### Self-care Mondays

As the year came closer to its end and I realised I still had a few more holiday days left I decided to spend them taking Mondays off whenever I could.

I called it self-care Mondays and would often spend the entire day with no distractions in complete silence as I did life-admin and writing.

### Minimal wardrobe

Four years ago I started to question why, despite loving my salmon-coloured t-shirts, I wore them so rarely?

As I began to uncover why an entire collection of reasons unfolded and set me on course for a journey that has already lasted for years.

And even though my wardrobe will never be finished, last year was the first year I made significant progress towards making it as minimal and meaningful as I want it to be.

## Relationships

It's often said that we're the average of the five people we surround ourselves with.

A [social influence study by Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler][social] suggests that in reality we're actually the average of our friends' friends, and our friends' friends' friends as well, called the Network phenomena.

### Reading Harry Potter to Lucien

Inspired by Rebecka's bedtime reading and Lucien's love of most things magical I asked him if he would be interested in reading the Harry Potter books together.

We've had a lot of fun reading together, having almost finished the Chamber of Secrets and coming to the definite conclusion that I can't do a Ron Weasley impression at all.

### Family game nights

I love playing board games---so much so that [I even designed my own][eternity].

So this year we've played classics such as Labyrinth and more modern games, such as Pandemic: Iberia and Merchants & Marauders and enjoyed them all.

But the most memorable game was without a doubt when Lucien won his first game of chess against me.

### Recreating childhood photos

My mom, siblings and I were laughing all the way through staging and [recreating our childhood photos][childhood].

We laughed even harder when we realised that in on the of them, we had gotten the children mixed up.

### Guest-starring on podcast

I was delighted to be invited as a guest to Sudden Double Deep, the podcast where they watch three films linked by a word in the title.

Choosing the word RUN to promote my marathon fundraiser meant I was responsible for subjecting us to murder by futuristic disco in **Loganâ€™s Run**, a pulse-pounding techno-pumping thriller with **Run Lola Run** and Simon Pegg doing his best to win back Thandie Newton in the romantic comedy **Run Fatboy Run**.

Daryl, Jeanette and Ben are awesome people and I couldn't have been more honoured to join them for an episode.

If you haven't already, [give them a listen on iTunes][sudden] or [Spotify][suddenspotify], you won't be disappointed.

### Date nights with Katy

Katy and I managed to go out a few nights as well, which meant we got to see Nancy and Suspiria at the 38th Cambridge Film Festival and Sarah Pascoe's LadsLadsLads at the Corn Exchange.

I look forward to more unplanned date nights.



## Learning

I am never healthier, spiritually and emotionally than when I'm learning, experiencing new things and challenging myself.

### Reading

I [planned on reading four books][book] and was thrilled when I put down Yuval Noah Harari's Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow as my 18th and last book of the year.

I won't tell you how many books I plan on reading this year but rest assured it'll be a single digit. ðŸ˜‰

### Half marathon PB (personal best)

Whilst my total running distance was less last year than the year before, I can take solace in the fact that just before the injury I managed to set a new PB during one of my training runs.

At 1:54:32, the sub-two-hour half marathon is something I'm very proud of and a testament to how far I've come since I started running.

### Ukulele

Sat in one of the rooms in the office at work is a ukulele.

It's been there for longer than I have, and every time I look at it I want to pick it up, tune it and learn how to play it.

So last year, I did just that.

Turns out, 20 years of acoustic guitar experience is quite a headstart when it comes to learning the ukulele so in a matter of hours, I had already learned how to play Elvis Presley's Can't Help Falling In Love.

### Tales from the Gun

Four months of writing and ~11,000 words later I finished the first draft of my second novella; titled Tales from the Gun, it tells the story of Trevor Miller, a mid-level hired killer whose gun suddenly starts talking to him.

Next, I'll be editing and sculpting the story into a more coherent one at which point I'll also talk more about it.

## Professional

I want to make this world a better place than it was when I arrived. I want to make it more inclusive to people, especially the people who have been marginalised and ignored for centuries.

### Learning how to lead

Inspired by Gavin Elliot's talk [Professional Progression][prof] I approached him for mentoring and although the time wasn't right to begin a long-distance mentorship his talk highlighted some of the professional aspects I had struggled to articulate.

That is; Leading a team of people in any discipline requires a completely different set of skills than being a member of that team.

And I needed to learn and improve on those skills.

## In hindsight

None of these things existed in any of my plans.

But they all happened anyway.

And all these things contributed to making my year a better, richer one.

Sometimes, it's not the plans we make that create the most lasting memories, it's the plans we don't.
