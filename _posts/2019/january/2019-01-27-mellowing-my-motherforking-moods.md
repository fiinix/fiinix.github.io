"How are you?" the inconspicuous app asks me for the 365th time in a row.

"Meh," I reply, tapping the middle emoji with an expressionless line as its smile.

Adding the different icons to illustrate my day I finish adding my mood for the day and think, "Has it been a whole year already?"

It feels like just yesterday that [I started tracking my daily mood][daylio] to better understand what makes me tick.

"Tick tock," and all that.

Along the way, I got to know myself a lot more but also realised that I'm not nearly as miserable as I thought.

And if the first six months were about understanding what and why I felt things, the consecutive six months were about managing those feelings and not letting them get the best of me.

It was about teaching my well-trodden neural highways to take new scenic routes where *Bad* days could become a little more bearable.

And whilst I had no intention of making *Good* days better---I was perfectly happy with them being good---it seems that my efforts had a more holistic effect.

*Since last time I've renamed Rad into Fantastic and Awful into Fucking Awful because who doesn't enjoy a little hyperbole in the day?*

</figure>

Total mood count: 78 Fantastic days, 218 Good days, 60 Meh days, 6 Bad days and 3 Fucking awful days.

Overall, at a 3.99 average score over the entire year, most of my days were in fact *Good* days.

Meanwhile, migraines and running injuries were the only contributors to *Fucking awful* days.

And whilst Thursdays' isn't my best day, it's interesting to note that during the year, I never had a bad Thursday.

But that's the aggregated data.

It's the big picture perspective, which although useful, doesn't help much in my day-to-day life with all its ups and downs.

It tells the story from a satellite view when what I need is a turn-by-turn direction for those crucial junctions where my otherwise unmanaged mood would take me down those well-trodden routes again.

Which is why I turn to psychology, to see if there were ways I could manage my moods when they needed to be managed.

## From acceptance to tolerance

Defence mechanisms are defined as things that reduce anxiety from unacceptable or potentially harmful stimuli.

The mechanisms themselves are grouped into different levels of "adulting"; from Psychotic, Immature, Neurotic to finally Mature---i.e. the, "You're an emotionally healthy adult now."

To determine where on the scale of "adulting" I fall I would need to complete the Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40, Andrews, Singh, & Bond, 1993).

Ideally, I would complete that and the Symptom Checklist 90; revised (SCL-90-R; Derogatis, 1983), a self-report measure of psychiatric symptoms, on an annual basis to learn which areas I need to focus on.

*But I haven't been able to get my hands on either manual yet and there are concerns that the face validity of DSQ-40 is insufficient and should be [replaced by DSQ-28][dsq-28] anyway.*

<p data-pullquote="I shouldnâ€™t apologise for fighting for my right."></p>

So for now, let's focus on all the Mature mechanisms that psychology suggests I should be able to use to navigate the road ahead.

They are; Acceptance, altruism, anticipation, courage, emotional self-regulation, emotional self-sufficiency, forgiveness, gratitude, humility, humour, identification, mercy, mindfulness, moderation, patience, respect, sublimation, suppression and tolerance.

*Woah, that's actually a lot more than I thought.*

A quick assessment, using a shortened version of DSQ-40, the [DSQ-14 web version][dsq-14], suggests, that whilst I have some mature ways of coping with things I also have quite a few neurotic mechanisms to work on.

{% highlight text %}
68. When I have to face a difficult situation I try to imagine what it will be like and plan ways to cope with it.

Strongly agree.
{% endhighlight %}

Which is a healthy and mature way (anticipation) of dealing with it. 

Though if I'm honest I think I catastrophise those difficult situations sometimes, which results in my plans being way too constrictive in my effort to control the outcome of that I've imagined instead of what really happens.

{% highlight text %}
71. After I fight for my rights, I tend to apologise for my assertiveness. 

Agree.
{% endhighlight %}

Which is a neurotic way (undoing) of dealing with my actions.

Psychology says neurotic mechanisms are quite common in adults and fine for short-term coping but become problematic when used as a primary way of coping.

In other words, I shouldn't apologise for fighting for my right.

I clearly still have areas to focus on and mental models to change to mellow these moods of mine.

But at least now I know where to look.

As I enter 2019, determined to continue tracking my moods, I'm finding Daylio itself a little lacking in nuance. Its one-dimensional abstraction isn't enough and I wish it was more multidimensional.

I've been looking for alternatives but haven't been able to find one that manages to include the scientific rigour of clinical studies with Daylio's ease-of-use.

*Maybe I need to learn how to make Android apps so I can make it myself?*

Meanwhile, it feels like the landscape has changed and these new scenic routes are giving me more joy and tranquillity than before.

And although I still have quite a few mature coping mechanisms to learn, I don't feel as overwhelmed by my moods as I used to.
