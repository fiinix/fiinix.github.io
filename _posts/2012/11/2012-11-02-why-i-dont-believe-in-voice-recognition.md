I'm going out tonight, so instead of NOT posting something---which wasn't really much of option given my recent challenge---I thought I would try the voice recognition on my phone. Turns out there doesn't seem to be a way to get a (dot) at the end of a sentence. Which makes for pretty odd sentences. Have fun deciphering the paragraph after the jump.
  
*Shit eating breakfast this morning xiaoning to the zoo so glad I found you should read I called last night and told me you were the opera of course I wish you had left was really glad you had a dreadful evening ha3 1 tragedy followed by another think you might telegraph first I've heard of it quite a chance navigate to sing along club wiki what is miserable fine if you could tell you how heartbroken I am old no you must suffer where are you did you go down to the guys for a moment of halloween speak easy address p somewhere in houston listen free entry sorel snow white or woman what is she must be in the only child did she say about it my dear how do I was sitting in a little while delicate call venetian glass I'm looking to.*
  
Unless you were able to figure it out, the paragraph was the beginning of Chapter VII from "A Picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde. Specifically, this paragraph:

*As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown into the room. "I am so glad I have found you, Dorian," he said, gravely. "I called last night, and they told me you were at the Opera. Of course I knew that was impossible. But I wish you had left word where you had really gone to. I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy might be followed by another. I think you might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first. I read of it quite by chance in a late edition of the Globe, that I picked up at the club. I came here at once, and was miserable at not finding you. I can't tell you how heart-broken I am about the whole thing. I know what you must suffer. But where were you? Did you go down and see the girl's mother? For a moment I thought of following you there. They gave the address in the paper. Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn't it? But I was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten. Poor woman! What a state she must be in! And her only child, too! What did she say about it all?" "My dear Basil, how do I know?" murmured Dorian, sipping some pale- yellow wine from a delicate gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass, and looking dreadfully bored.*

See you tomorrow.
