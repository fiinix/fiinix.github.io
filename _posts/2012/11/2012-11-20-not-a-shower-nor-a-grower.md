excerpt: "In which I grow a moustache to raise awareness for men's health issues, such as prostate cancer, testicular cancer and men's suicide."

As you might remember I was going to raise awareness for cancer by growing a pitiful moustache. Here's some photographic evidence of my — so far — less than impressive attempt at growing a 'stache. Let this be a lesson to everyone. I challenge you to **not** look like an idiot, in a moustache.

A part of me would love to take this opportunity to say that I'm more of a grower than a shower…but who are we kidding, we can all see the metaphorical and hairless elephant in the room. Turns out, I'm not much of a grower either. Damn it. Oh well. At least I was right when I predicted I would look ridiculous with a moustache. But without further ado. Here you go.

As you can see the resemblance between me and my avatar is uncanny. If we both walked around town I bet you couldn't tell us apart. Well, except for the fact that we're wearing different t-shirts. Yeah, just that. Nothing else.

And well… I have a knack for not being able to take anything too seriously… ever. So obviously I had to do a less serious picture. Consider this my greeting to all my friends back in Finland! And that one in Sweden. One in Lichtenstein. And one in Thailand.

I hope that was all of them.
