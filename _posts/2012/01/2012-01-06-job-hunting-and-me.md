I'm being busy hunting for a job in the UK, remember?

I talked about it [last time](/blog/come-take-me). Which is why I must confess that there won't be a whole lot of posting (again) for the time being.. yeah I know.. it's a shame, but I need to keep focused with one eye on the goal at all times. And obviously being that focused takes time and energy..

But here's a playlist with some awesome tunes from e.g. Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman to keep you entertained whilst you wait.
