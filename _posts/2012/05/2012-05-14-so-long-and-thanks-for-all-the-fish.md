It was delicious. Oh, well.. it was okay at least. Goodbye Finland. As soon as I've gotten the worst of the travelling smell of me,.. that and the smell of cat urine. Don't ask. Anyway, as soon as I have taken care of the smell I am going to make a post about the differences between Finland and UK, some common myths regarding the weather and such. So you know, stay tuned and what not. Now I need to go find some food.
