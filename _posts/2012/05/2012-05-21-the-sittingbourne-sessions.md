Here's.. finally.. a new video. It's quick, dirty and to be perfectly honest, a bit shit. But a sort of, good shit I suppose.. adequate bowl-movement perhaps? Remember [months ago](/blog/thanks-but-no) I sort of promised I would upload a video of me singing Accidents Can Happen, because that's the song I sang when auditioning for Idols? Well, I figured that they might upload a video of it, because I did an extra take for some behind the scenes web stuff, but alas that never made it to their website. So here's the song I sang for the Idols judges + two more songs. Partly because my wife thought I did the Kent song better (she's right) and partly because I thought it would be fun to do a little Bruno Mars.

Obviously my plan is totally to make a part II to this. But you know me, one doth never know if I will.

## Set list

- Accidents Can Happen - Sixx A.M (0:15)
- Utan Dina Andetag - Kent (5:16)
- Grenade - Bruno Mars (9:42)

Also, fyi. I totally got the job.
