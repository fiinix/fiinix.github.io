So yeah. I suppose some of you might have been waiting for this post.

Prepare to be disappointed.

Good, now we have that out of the way I can.. well.. not really write much at all. I have spent the past three hours designing various charts in Illustrator and now I'm too tired to actually write anything yet. So it'll have to wait. Yeah, I know.. I'm terrible. But at least, when I do get all the charts done I can make an awesomely long post about the weather and how our journey has gone so far. Right now I wouldn't be able to tell much anyway since everything is in a state of uncertainty. Today I filled out all the various forms that are required when letting (renting) a flat (an apartment). Now we're waiting to see.. do we get the apartment or not. So hopefully you'll bear with me as I promise to bare with you soon enough.. soon, my precious..

If nothing else, maybe you got a good chuckle out of the title?

No? Okay.. here's a picture of the palm tree that grew in the back yard of the [first accommodation](http://rentinkent.net/onebed.html) (link goes to our specific accommodation) we rented when we arrived in England. Many thanks to Duncan, he was great.
