excerpt: "In which I attend a job interview in the UK and feel like it's promising."

Interview done and I feel as though it went very well, come start of next week we'll see if I was right. And not just that, it feels like the kind of place where I would sincerely enjoy working. So double awesome!

So yeah, to all of my many, many (seven) readers out there, fingers crossed and let's hope for greatness.
