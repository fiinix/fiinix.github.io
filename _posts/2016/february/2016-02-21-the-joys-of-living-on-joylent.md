At first, I wasn't sure what Rebecka would think about the experiment Benjamin and I had in mind.

So I cautiously approached her.

"So---" expecting her reaction to be one of disgust, "---would you mind if I ate nothing but a meal replacement beverage for a whole week?"

To which she exclaimed, "Oooh yeah! Lucien and I are going to indulge on whatever we want for a whole week."

Clearly, she was more than okay with this little experiment.

I now suspect that she caters to my preferences more than I give her credit for.

But with her excited consent [Benjamin][beije] and I decided to embark on this stupid journey of ours.

<p data-pullquote="You have ruined everything thatâ€™s good about being alive."></p>

[Joylent][joylent], the <abbr title="European Union" class="small-caps">EU</abbr> equivalent of Soylent, is a full day of balanced nutrition in a powdered food shake.

Unlike things like Herbalife, Juice Plus and Lighterlife which are meal complements, Joylent is intended as a meal *replacement.*

100% of your daily recommended intake of all essential vitamins and nutrients in a handy shake. It comes as a powder and is mixed with water, creating a drink with a milkshake-like consistency. The idea is that you drink it three times a day and that's it, 100% of your required nutrition.

No cooking. No cleaning---apart for the shaker. And most importantly, no time wasted.

Because I ordered this a couple of months ago, I was pleasantly surprised to find a little something extra in my shipment as well.

A sample of their then Christmas special, Joylent Apple Pie.

*I'm going to save this for Saturday and treat myself to a Joylent breakfast to finish this experiment.*

A little more research shows me that in terms of opinions, people on the internet---as people on the internet tend to---have a lot of them.

Some guy said, <q>This is the future of food</q>. Someone else thinks that, <q>You \[Joylent\] have ruined everything that's good about being alive.</q>

Opinions vary, in other words.

I've made my first batch and it's sitting in the fridge, cooling down, ready for tomorrow. I suppose we will know soon enough on which side I stand.

I will update this entry every evening. Join me again tomorrow, as the experiment begins.

## Day 1, Mango Monday

Because I didn't want my own bias to---pun intended---flavour the results I've randomised the order in which I will drink the different flavour. Also knowing myself I would have saved the dreaded banana flavour for last. Only to regret it come Friday.

But first up is; Mango.

## Day 2, Banana

## Day 3, Strawberry

## Day 4, Chocolate

## Day 5, Vanilla

## Conclusion

Apple Pie.
