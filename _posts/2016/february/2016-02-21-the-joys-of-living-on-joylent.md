At first, I wasn't sure what Rebecka would think about the experiment Benjamin and I had in mind.

So I cautiously approached her.

"So---" expecting her reaction to be one of disgust, "---would you mind if I ate nothing but a meal replacement beverage for a whole week?"

To which she exclaimed, "Oooh yeah! Lucien and I are going to indulge on whatever we want for a whole week."

Clearly, she was more than okay with this little experiment.

I now suspect that she caters to my preferences more than I give her credit for.

But with her excited consent [Benjamin][beije] and I decided to embark on this stupid journey of ours.

<p data-pullquote="You have ruined everything that’s good about being alive."></p>

[Joylent][joylent], the <abbr title="European Union" class="small-caps">EU</abbr> equivalent of Soylent, is a full day of balanced nutrition in a powdered food shake.

Unlike things like Herbalife, Juice Plus and Lighterlife which are meal complements, Joylent is intended as a meal *replacement.*

100% of your daily recommended intake of all essential vitamins and nutrients in a handy shake. It comes as a powder and is mixed with water, creating a drink with a milkshake-like consistency. The idea is that you drink it three times a day and that's it, 100% of your required nutrition.

No cooking. No cleaning---apart for the shaker. And most importantly, no time wasted.

Because I ordered this a couple of months ago, I was pleasantly surprised to find a little something extra in my shipment as well.

A sample of their then Christmas special, Joylent Apple Pie.

*I'm going to save this for Saturday and treat myself to a Joylent breakfast to finish this experiment.*

A little more research shows me that in terms of opinions, people on the internet---as people on the internet tend to---have a lot of them.

Some guy said, <q>This is the future of food</q>. Someone else thinks that, <q>You \[Joylent\] have ruined everything that's good about being alive.</q>

Opinions vary, in other words.

I've made my first batch and it's sitting in the fridge, cooling down, ready for tomorrow. I suppose we will know soon enough on which side I stand.

I will update this entry every evening. Join me again tomorrow, as the experiment <del>begins</del> <ins>continues</ins>.

***

Because I didn't want my own bias to---pun intended---flavour the results I've randomised the order in which I will drink the different flavours. This is also to prevent me from saving the dreaded banana flavour for last. Which I would have regretted on Friday morning.

## Day 1, Mango Monday

First up; Mango.

I had read that it's better if you mix it the night before and cool it in the fridge. Which is exactly what I did.

The texture is---not good at all---like weird fruit juice with chalk.

Gritty.

It tastes and smells like mango, I guess. I quite like mango but my whole body is telling me that this, in fact, is *not mango*. My body is very confused. I finished my first meal in about 20 minutes and I feel like I have a slight migraine coming on.

I spend the rest of the day feeling a bit shit. Not bad but not great either and the level 2 migraine I got from my breakfast lingers until early evening. After some quick research---fearing the worst---I find a [Soylent discussion][headache] where other people appear to experience a similar problem.

The suspected culprits; Potassium and Sodium.

Or specifically; my body getting enough, a lot more, Potassium than it's used to and a lot less Sodium than it's used to.

It's that [fucking Potassium again][bananas]. The bane of my life.

So I cheat a little and nibble on three [FINN CRISP Original][finncrisp]. In part to get more Sodium in me and in part because my jaw is longing to chew something, anything.

Now, truth be told, I get migraines occasionally and I can't be 100% sure that it wasn't just another episode.

But.

Having said that.

I'm blaming the Potassium. It's meant to subside once the body adjust to getting every nutrition it needs and most people seem to only experience it for 1&ndash;2 days.

Current joy of living on Joylent: *No joy. This isn't living.*

## Day 2, Banana Tuesday

Figures. I would get the fucking banana flavour today.

After yesterday's migraine and the slight nausea that followed I wasn't very hopeful for today.

Smelling the concoction I had mixed didn't reassure me in way, shape or form either. Instead I was filled with dread and flashbacks of going to the dentist---and receiving a not-quite-banana flavoured Fluoride varnish.

But.

It wasn't bad.

Either I'm subconsciously already experiencing Stockholm Syndrome or I have adjusted to consuming sustenance in this sludge form.

Because everything has been fine, I've been fine.

Aside for trying to stay hydrated in general, I'm also making sure to drink a large glass of water before and after I've had my meals.

Unlike yesterday, I am also *secretly* farting a lot less today.

And with the least appetising flavours out of the way I'm *almost* looking forward to rest of the week.

Current joy of living on Joylent: *Yeah, this isn't so bad. I think I can manage.*

## Day 3, Strawberry Wednesday

After yesterday's complete success I was hesitant about today.

There are few things in this world whose flavour I enjoy more than pistachios and salty liquorice but strawberry is definitely one of them.

Which meant my mind was playing out various scenarios on how they would have ruined my beloved strawberry forever.

But it was fine.

It tasted like any other strawberry-flavoured candy you can imagine but not quite as sickly-sweet.

The texture remains the same. The morning meal is thicker because I mix it the night before but I'm finding it a little too dissolved and lacking in texture.

*Look at me. Two days ago I was complaining about the gritty texture and today I'm complaining about the lack of grit.*

	<figcaption>I expected it to be more difficult to mix the shake but I’ve had no problems with it at all.</figcaption>

But.

Today is also the first day I'm feeling more hungry than bloated. I suppose it's understandable considering that in my effort to bulk up I've become used to consuming ~2300 calories per day.

Joylent *only* has 2119 calories.

But I've been snacking on those three crisp breads since Monday as well, adding a consistent 190 calories to my daily Joylent consumption.

So at a total of 2309 calories I should be fine but I'm still feeling hungry.

To make things stranger I'm not actually feeling any effects of hunger though. It would appear that I'm *feeling hungry* without actually *being hungry*. Rebecka, who can attest to that I get very irritable from not eating frequently enough, confirmed that I have been perfectly fine.

On a more positive note---and less strange as well---I'm happy to tell you that my *secret* farting has almost subsided completely.

Current joy of living on Joylent: *Doing the [Hit The Quan][quan] dance whilst singing, "Straw-straw-strawberry motherfucker!*
