At first, I wasn't sure what Rebecka would think about the experiment Benjamin and I had in mind.

So I cautiously approached her.

"So---" expecting her reaction to be one of disgust, "---would you mind if I ate nothing but a meal replacement beverage for a whole week?"

To which she exclaimed, "Oooh yeah! Lucien and I are going to indulge on whatever we want for a whole week."

Clearly, she was more than okay with this little experiment.

I now suspect that she caters to my preferences more than I give her credit for.

But with her excited consent [Benjamin][beije] and I decided to embark on this stupid journey of ours.

<p data-pullquote="You have ruined everything thatâ€™s good about being alive."></p>

[Joylent][joylent], the <abbr title="European Union" class="small-caps">EU</abbr> equivalent of Soylent, is a full day of balanced nutrition in a powdered food shake.

Unlike things like Herbalife, Juice Plus and Lighterlife which are meal complements, Joylent is intended as a meal *replacement.*

100% of your daily recommended intake of all essential vitamins and nutrients in a handy shake. It comes as a powder and is mixed with water, creating a drink with a milkshake-like consistency. The idea is that you drink it three times a day and that's it, 100% of your required nutrition.

No cooking. No cleaning---apart for the shaker. And most importantly, no time wasted.

Because I ordered this a couple of months ago, I was pleasantly surprised to find a little something extra in my shipment as well.

A sample of their then Christmas special, Joylent Apple Pie.

*I'm going to save this for Saturday and treat myself to a Joylent breakfast to finish this experiment.*

A little more research shows me that in terms of opinions, people on the internet---as people on the internet tend to---have a lot of them.

Some guy said, <q>This is the future of food</q>. Someone else thinks that, <q>You \[Joylent\] have ruined everything that's good about being alive.</q>

Opinions vary, in other words.

I've made my first batch and it's sitting in the fridge, cooling down, ready for tomorrow. I suppose we will know soon enough on which side I stand.

I will update this entry every evening. Join me again tomorrow, as the experiment <del>begins</del> <ins>continues</ins>.

***

Because I didn't want my own bias to---pun intended---flavour the results I've randomised the order in which I will drink the different flavours. This is also to prevent me from saving the dreaded banana flavour for last. Which I would have regretted on Friday morning.

## Day 1, Mango Monday

First up; Mango.

I had read that it's better if you mix it the night before and cool it in the fridge. Which is exactly what I did.

The texture is---not good at all---like weird fruit juice with chalk.

Gritty.

It tastes and smells like mango, I guess. I quite like mango but my whole body is telling me that this, in fact, is *not mango*. My body is very confused. I finished my first meal in about 20 minutes and I feel like I have a slight migraine coming on.

I spend the rest of the day feeling a bit shit. Not bad but not great either and the level 2 migraine I got from my breakfast lingers until early evening. After some quick research---fearing the worst---I find a [Soylent discussion][headache] where other people appear to experience a similar problem.

The suspected culprits; Potassium and Sodium.

Or specifically; my body getting enough, a lot more, Potassium than it's used to and a lot less Sodium than it's used to.

It's that [fucking Potassium again][bananas]. The bane of my life.

So I cheat a little and nibble on three [FINN CRISP Original][finncrisp]. In part to get more Sodium in me and in part because my jaw is longing to chew something, anything.

Now, truth be told, I get migraines occasionally and I can't be 100% sure that it wasn't just another episode.

But.

Having said that.

I'm blaming the Potassium. It's meant to subside once the body adjust to getting every nutrition it needs and most people seem to only experience it for 1&ndash;2 days.

Current joy of living on Joylent: *No joy. This isn't living.*
