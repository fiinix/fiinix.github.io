excerpt: "In which I talk about the experience of suddenly finding myself hunting for another job and all of the vices this comes with."
---
A part of my, our, world collapsed last February.

In a M. Night Shyamalan twist I suddenly found myself without a job.

Fear, anxiety and all those other voices we all have in our heads clawed their way up from deep within the dark crevices of my subconscious.

As I started making plans I did my best to keep the voices of doubt---who sounds strangely like Gollum---at bay. *We likes it here. We’ll never go away.*

I told Rebecka's the bad news who, as you already know, had bad news of her own. I jokingly knocked on our wooden table as I said, "Well this can't get any worse." *Just you wait, it can always get worser.*

Thankfully, for a change, it actually didn't.

## Making a plan

To not sink with the proverbial ship, we needed a plan. *Sinking isn't so bad, it's the drowning that'll kill you.*

I called all of our utility suppliers to let them know our situation and that any unpaid bills would be delayed by a month. But that I would inform them as soon as our situation changed. *It's never going to change, you're fucked. So fucked.*

<p data-pullquote="♫ ♪ You’re gonna starve to death, you’re gonna starve to death."></p>

We looked at our recurring spendings trying to find which ones we could cut out. *Don't you dare take our precious spendings. Filthy human.*

We went into frugal mode again, something we've done on the past for varying reasons, thinking about what provisions and dishes are cheap but not shit. *♫ ♪ You're gonna starve to death, you're gonna starve to death, you're gonna starve to death.*

The plan was to be able to make next month's rent even if we didn't have any more money coming in this month. *And there won't be any money every again.*

## The hunt is on

I thrive in routines and I knew I needed to keep one despite having no one to push me. Rebecka's is awesome and supportive, but pushy, she isn't and she shouldn't have to be. *We'll distract you at every turn. Pushing and prodding at your weak spots.*

Recent requests to provide consultancy services meant I've not only found myself looking for a job, but also making one of my own. I'll go into more detail about the consultancy business when the ideas are a little more concrete. *You? A filthy business owner? A few years ago you could barely hold on to money from month to month.*

> Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work. <cite>Thomas Edison</cite>

I decided to spend the morning building my consultancy business and the afternoons hunting for jobs. *It will never work. You'll never work.*

If either of those got sidetracked by each other, e.g. a job lead comes in first thing in the morning, then I would just switch them around rather than get hung up on procedures. After all, their my procedures to ignore. *Ignore them, ignore them all.*

I would keep my lunch hour and have a healthy snack on either side of the lunch, as I had been doing before. *All that hard work and exercise will be gone in a month. You'll wither away.*

## Never being good enough

I always forget how much I hate updating my <abbr title="Curriculum Vitae" class="small-caps">CV</abbr>, until I'm actually updating my <abbr class="small-caps">CV</abbr>.

Somehow the very act of trying to emphasise all the good things about myself makes me question every single one of them.

"Am I really? No, I probably shouldn't put that there, I've only done it for a year. Mmm, I'm not too sure about that, I've only spoken about it a couple of times."

And at the same time as I'm filled with this growing monster of a sense of self-loathing, another voice from deeper still---or not as deep, I can't be sure---tells me, "Sssh, you're awesome and any employer would be lucky to have you. Also look at you, your gorgeous!" *You're ugly and shit and no one wants to hire you. You jobless, worthless---*

---Sometimes the voices cancel each other out.

If there's was a single advice I could give it would be this; Write a <abbr class="small-caps">CV</abbr> for the job you want, not the job you have---but don't lie. *Oh, handing out advise now? As if you know what you're talking about.*

I also did what I imagine most people in my industry do nowadays and [update my LinkedIn profile][linkedin]---which is about as fun as you could imagine. *We love draining you of your will to live.*

<p data-pullquote="Rinse and repeat ‘til death set you free."></p>

But I also did something which is completely new, at least to me, which was to tweet about my situation---which I did from the moment it happened.

And that was my plan. Find companies who were looking for someone or a company I would like to work with and send them an email. *That they'll ignore or print out to laugh at.*

I always strived to write it for them specifically instead of copy pasting a cookie cutter email. But I'll admit that on more tired days I would send something which had been reworded very little. *Such little rewords, it's as if you didn't write anything at all.*

Rinse and repeat. *Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat 'til death set you free.*

As excepted, sending emails comes with a varying degrees of success. *We told you, no one wants you.*

LinkedIn on the other hand is a great source of you want to be attacked by the land sharks that are recruitment agencies; messages with the footnote that if this isn't suitable for me then I should send it to someone who is.

I don't know about you, but to me that sounds awfully a lot like your asking me to do your job for you. *Without paying you, it's really quite beautiful isn't it?*

I was quite surprised when Twitter by far had the most qualitative results. From only a few tweets---I tried not to spam people---I got approached by amongst other Shopify and the <abbr title="British Broadcasting Corporation" class="small-caps">BBC</abbr>.

After interview here and interviewed there, a few of which were with Shopify, I have decided to join the enthusiastic team at Studio 24 in Cambridge.

> Studio 24 is an award-winning web design and development agency based in Cambridge. As a full-service digital agency, Studio 24 offer a complete range of creative, technical and search marketing services. 

And just like that, the voices dissipate. *For now.*

## The next exciting chapter

Thank you to everyone's kind and supportive words. That includes you dear reader, yes you, right there. Thank you.

I'm sorry we've been a little unreachable lately but we've just needed to focus our energy and time on getting through this.

A truly heartfelt thank you to everyone who retweeted my tweets. There aren't enough words to tell you how much I appreciate people bringing me to the attention of potential employers.

A big, individual thank you to;

And one person whose account is protected and out of respect for that I won't publish their name here but, "Thank you too."

Some of you, such as Paul Davis and Stuart Robson, even retweeted me more than once. I guess I owe you two hugs---though you can redeem it for one long and awkward hug instead.

I really meant it when I said I would trade hugs for retweets. I owe all of you a hug---except Jo, my former colleague, who opted out---and whenever you see me, at a conference or elsewhere, feel free to redeem my sign of appreciation.

And whilst words can't begin to describe how grateful I am, here's 1500+ words were I try.

Thank you.
