excerpt: "In which I apologise for the lack of entries but make no effort the remedy it."

As I'm sure you've noticed there's been a distinct lack of entries, even by my standards.

The reason for this is simple.

I was supposed to write a Keeping Up With the Erikssons entry a couple of weeks ago but I got ill. First I lied in a 7-day fever and once that was over I had a few days of hypothermia and I started coughing blood.

I try to live by a simple motto; "If there's ever blood coming out of a hole where blood shouldn't come out, go to the doctor."

So, to the doctor I went.

They sent me for a chest x-ray which showed spots in my lungs, suggesting pneumonia and I was given antibiotics, which I just finished taking the other day.

I know it's not a *good excuse* but it's an excuse nonetheless.

In light of this I decided to extend the Keeping Up With the Erikssons entry until after my self-mandated holiday. In other words, my usual blogging holiday of July&ndash;August is now from June all the way August.

See in you at the end of August.
