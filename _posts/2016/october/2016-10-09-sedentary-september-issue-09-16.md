Picking up from where we left off last month, we were just about to move from Maidstone to Cambridge.

## Moving to Cambridge

After having found a new home, we spent the last week of August and the first week of September getting ready to move.

The plan was simple. Well, *simple-ish*.

Having packed *almost* all of our possessions, I dismantled the bed on the moving morning and we got the last things ready for the movers to transport.

I took the train up to Cambridge to make sure everything had made its way to its new home safe and sound. Meanwhile Rebecka stayed behind and did the final cleaning, making sure our old home was in representable state for the landlord's final inspection.

After sending out a few quote requests, I had settled on [Express Removals][express], a local company who also provided a free, no-obligation home visit to determine the moving costs more accurately.

I was really nervous for what Rebecka would think when she finally got to step inside her/our new home.

Oh yeah, keep in mind that at this point she hadn't actually been to our new home.

In fact, before we moved Rebecka and Lucien had only been up to Cambridge *once*, to sign the contract. They had only seen the front door as there hadn't been time to view our 2-bedroom terraced house.

The garish bright blue door had been painted a pleasant green---something that matches many of our decorations---which we took as a sign that this truly is our new home.

Presumably she should like it, she picked had after all, but some homes look picturesque online and then like the inside of a Marmite yar in reality--mouldy and disgusting. And whilst one hopes for the former, one is always mentally prepared for the latter.

On Thursday---the day after we had gotten all our stuff moved---we handed back the keys to what had been our home for the past 4+ years and said goodbye to Maidstone as we made our train journey up to Cambridge, to our new home for the foreseeable future.

So yeah, I was pretty nervous about what she would think now that she finally got to set foot in our new home.



## Chariots of Fire

Seriously, what is up with people who run? Why do you get up so frustratingly early?

These and more, were questions Rebecka asked as Lucien and her were forced to get up at 7am to cheer me on as a ran another race for charity.

In the end, and because we were already a little late in the morning I told them, "Go back home and sleep some more, there will be other races where I'll want your presence and support."

So they did and I could warm-up by jogging to the start of the race.

## Folk musem

3 out of 5 dusty old Norweigan ice skating sharpeners.

## Birthdayn cupcakes

Rebecka turned 30, which for those of you know who know our story, is a pretty epic fucking reason to celebrate.

She had considered having an actual birthday party but because we had just moved

So much so that we bake club
