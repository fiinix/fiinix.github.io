A quick look at the calendar reveals that it's that time of the month again.

The time when I look back at the month that has been and try to remember what we've done in an effort to keep family and friends up-to-date with our lives.

Looking back, this month hasn't been particularly interesting. We've continued to grieve and move on with life---because it moves on regardless.

## One of hell's minions

I continue commuting to and from my new work in Cambridge. I've already written about my commuting experience in the entry [Dante's Tenth Circle: Commuting][commuting], and I think it's a quite interesting read.

## Eating Joylent again

After the success of [eating Joylent for a week][joylent] I suppose it was only a matter of time before the meal replacement beverage managed to sneak its way into my dietary routines.

Faced with the uncertainty of regular meals that comes with commuting for 6.5 hour ever day I decided I needed to make sure I got enough food.

It didn't take long before my thoughts to return to Joylent. I asked Rebecka what she thought---just to make sure I wasn't doing something stupid---but when she agreed, I ordered a month's supply of Joylent.

Unlike last time I had no plans of sustaining on Joylent alone. Instead I'm using Joylent as the base which ensures I get enough food. If opportunites arise where I'm presented with better dining options I will gladly take them.

## Captain America: Civil War

The massive multi-film narrative that is Marvel released their next instalment Captain America: Civil War last week.

Since Lucien and I have caught up with all the films they've made so far so I surprised him with a visit to the cinema last Saturday. We were going to watch the how the story continues and how the split between Iron Man and Captain America happens.

Unlike last time---where I accidentally spoiled Star Wars---I'm now going to be more cautious about spoiling films. I know some people take it very seriously and I want to respect that.

We both really enjoyed the film and I'm already looking forward to the next one. Captain America: Civil War might just become my new favourite.

## Monthly challenge

Last month's challenge was to spend 30 minutes every day on Duolingo learning Danish.

Did I?

Hahahahahaha hahahahahahahaha haha hahahahahahaha hahahahahaha hahahaha hahahaha hahahaha hahahahaha hahahahaha ha.

No.

I spent [sporadic moments at best on Duolingo learning Danish][duolingo].

And with two days into next month's challenge; taking a photo every day with a different theme, and no photos taken I'm off to an excellent---not at all---start.

But I'm going to go out and take some photos now.

I really want to familiarise myself more with [the Canon 100D I got last year][camera] and making one of the monthly challenges seemed like the perfect excuse. But to be honest, I hadn't imagined taking it with me to Cambridge every day but I'll figure out something that works.

In case anyone is interested in joining my already failing endeavour, here's the list of all the themes and their corresponding day. I'll be writing a journal entry where I'll include all the photos once I've completed the challenge.

1. Sky and Clouds
2. Vintage Signs
3. Sunsets and Sunrises
4. Star Wars
5. Shapes
6. Self-Portraits
7. Social Issues
8. Film
9. Holidays
10. Abstract and Conceptual
11. Street Portraits
12. Letters or Numbers
13. Architecture
14. Emotions
15. Colour
16. Specific Architecture
17. Food
18. Textures
19. Graffiti
20. Black and White
21. Seasonal
22. Perspectives
23. Setup Scenes
24. Reflections
25. Instagram
26. Tattoos and Piercings
27. Nighttime
28. Music
29. Shadows
30. Urban Exploration
31. Rerun/Pick one from previous themes

I would love it if you joined me---mostly because it might actually motivate me to finish the challenge.

If you do, let me know and I'll include a link to your photos or blog as well when I write about it again at the end of the month.

Let's get shooting.

And that's it for this month.
