It comes as a surprise to many people when they find out that we don't have a <abbr title="television" class="small-caps">TV</abbr>, like it somehow makes us this odd anachronistic hipster family---which I suppose is partly true.

Truth is though, we didn't make much of an effort to become free of the shackles of television in the first place.

We simply stopped making an effort to keep up with the steady onslaught of technological development.

We never saw a reason to get a new <abbr class="small-caps">TV</abbr>---the old one I had was only capable of receiving an analogue signal---once Finland ceased their analogue broadcasts back in 2007.

So without the broadcasts, our <abbr class="small-caps">TV</abbr> only served as the screen for our XBMC-powered media station. *Which we enjoyed until 2012 when I retired it in correlation to our move to the <abbr title="United Kingdom" class="small-caps">UK</abbr>.*

And it's not like we're completely cut of from the world, we just get to *choose* everything we absorb, instead of having it forced down our Nielsen rated throats.

I still remember the shock of having a <abbr class="small-caps">TV</abbr> again, after a 5 year hiatus.

For the brief time when we first moved to the <abbr class="small-caps">UK</abbr>, both our self-catering accommodations we stayed in had a Digibox and <abbr class="small-caps">TV</abbr> and both Rebecka and I was quite shocked by the whole experience.

We hadn't actually thought that living without a <abbr class="small-caps">TV</abbr> would make such a difference but as it turned out, we had simply repressed any notion of the ridiculous amount of advertisement that we, as viewers, are subjected to.

Ad after ad, violently brain-washing us to think we want shit that we don't need.

Curiously, studies show that having a <abbr class="small-caps">TV</abbr> on in the background is more harmful then actively watching it.

As you can probably imagine, we were pretty happy to get our own place and *not* have a <abbr class="small-caps">TV</abbr> again.

And as we're entering our ninth year of being <abbr class="small-caps">TV</abbr> free I can't say that I miss it.

Do you think you could handle a life without <abbr class="small-caps">TV</abbr>?
