As we're already over a week into March, the idea of writing a journal entry every day seems pretty far fetched.

In fact, it seems down right impossible. Because it is.

Today is the ninth and I have quite clearly *not* written every day.

But this month's challenge is to write more, and despite the rocky start that's what I'm going to do.

Back in 2011, Chris Shiflett wrote a [blog post titled Ideas of March][shiflett]. After years of being an active Twitter user he felt that as more and more conversations had moved to Twitter their quality had also degraded.

And he had a point.

Blogs, or journals as I've decided to call mine, really are great, aren't they?

Chris wanted to revive the humble blog.

His instructions were simple and clear.

- Write a post called Ideas of March.
- List some of the reasons you like blogs.
- Pledge to blog more the rest of the month.
- Share your thoughts on Twitter with the [#ideasofmarch][twitter] hashtag.

Which is why I'm taking the opportunity this month to make an effort to write and publish more.

## What I like about blogs

Blogs are intimate. Unlike Facebook, Twitter and other social spaces, a personal blog doesn't get lost in the noise of targetted ads. Blogs are personal, like being invited to someone's dinner table.

And that invitation should be met with respect and kindness.

I invite you to my personal space every time I post an entry. But I feel equally blessed when you invite me to your personal space.

It's humbling to get to read about your life experiences, getting to---just for a second or two---walk in your shoes. And if I can do the same for you, well then we've shared something amazing.

The amazing mental connection that these words create, the bridge between the moment I'm living right now and the moment you're living as you read this, shouldn't be squandered or taken for granted.

However fleeting it is.

And whilst I'm unlikely to write something worthy of being published every day, I pledge to write more.

Let's create more amazing moment this month.
