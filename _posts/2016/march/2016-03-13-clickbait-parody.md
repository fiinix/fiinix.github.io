When I first saw this, I couldn't believe my eyes and neither will you.

*More after the break.*

I am literally picking my own jaw up from the floor because of this amazing 1 thing.

*You won't believe what happens next will be revealed after these commercials.*

Have I told you how much I hate clickbait links?

I hate them deeply and profoundly with a passion that knows no bounds. When the world ends, it won't be with a bang or a whisper, it will be with a stupid fucking clickbait link.

1 fucking video split across 4 fucking pages of ads---that I block anyway---before I am shown the great reveal, which always turns out to be a massive disappointment anyway.

Which is why I've decided to contribute to demise of humanity. The robot overlords will take over soon enough anyway.

Oh, right. About the actual thing.

I suffer from <abbr title="Autosomal Dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst Syndrome" class="small-caps">ACHOO</abbr>.

Well, I say *suffer* but that's probably not the right word for it.

*Curiously, this genetic quirk is actually more common than green eyes, which I also have so I guess I won the genetic lottery.*

I have a condition more commonly referred to as a [photic sneeze reflex][wiki].

And because of this, I sneeze every time I eat dark chocolate.

No, really, I do.

But I'll be honest with you. It can be quite nice sometimes, I mean who doesn't enjoy getting to release a good sneeze or three?
