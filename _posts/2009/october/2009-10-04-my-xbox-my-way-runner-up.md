I should remembered that I entered an Avatar competition some weeks ago, turns out I made it to runner up in the competition, which I a nice way of saying I didn't win. But that's okay, I made it quite far anyway which is really cool. Here's the screenshot from [xbox.com][xbox], I wanted to save it as a memorabilia. As you can see mines to the far right and not to blow my own whistle too much (just the appropriate amount) I think my design was/is better the winner's one...

I linked it too, but alas I don't know how long it will be there...

EDIT: As requested by beije, here's the entry I sent in, he pointed out nicely that you can barely see the design in the "tiny" screenshot.
