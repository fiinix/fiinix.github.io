excerpt: Another T-shirt design.
---
Got a request to post an other design I've done some time ago (Yes among all other things I also design T-Shirts)

So here it is. I can't really take credit for the design though I just made this composition and re-vectored it for T-Shirt.

Yes it's Master Chief and yes, I'm a Halo fan. There I said it, now move it along and enjoy the design instead. :P
