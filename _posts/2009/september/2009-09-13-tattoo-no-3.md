excerpt: In which I finally unveil the third tattoo.

And here's what my tattoo now looks like. I didn't feel like posting a picture of it right away, I mean who really wants to see a tattoo that red and swollen... This is what it looks like right now, which is about a week and a half since I had it made. It's not completely healed yet and the club -part looks a bit off in this picture but I am personally very pleased with it.

Many thanks to [Kodi][fist] who came to my home to do the tattoo. And good luck in Canada!

That's all for now... now fuck off.
