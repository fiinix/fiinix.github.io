excerpt: I try my hand at polyphasic sleeping for a few days but only ever mention it twice in a day and then never again.

Tried napping at 17.00 for 30 minutes, it really didn't feel like I fell asleep but for some reason I felt way more energized afterward than I had felt before the nap. I was a bit groggy for like 30 minutes after I "woke" up, but nothing out of the ordinary. So I decided to try to make some chili bread. I just took them out of the oven and now the apartment smells delicious.

It'll be interesting to see what tomorrow is like, seeing as I haven't tried sleeping for only 4,5 hours yet, last I slept about 6,5 as a form of easing into it. Might have to adjust the night one still, even though it would be nice to manage on 5 hours/24 hours.

I'm going to go enjoy some bread now.
