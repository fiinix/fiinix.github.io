No, I didn't name a song interlude... this is something you would know if you had read my earlier posts. I just feel the strong need to express my disappointment with youtube's uploader. After 3 hours of uploading the next part of performance, it just decide to give me a random "some unknown error occurred...". So now I'm annoyed. And also decided to try to shrink it down before I try the next time, as I'm the first to admit that the file sizes are ridiculously huge for a couple of minutes of singing, but then again that's what you get for trying to maintain quality. We'll see how that works out. So here's something randomly funny while we wait..
