excerpt: Another creature named Jack. I really need to stop naming things Jack.
---
Let's call him Jack.. I have tendency to name things Jack, ask some of my friends and they'll agree with me.

Anyway, I don't really feel like posting a really long explanation or anything, this is just a random experiment I did in Photoshop, trying out the Wacom Graphire4 XL that I purchased years ago and to this day haven't used nearly as much as I thought I would.. but mark my words.. one day I will.. The original is about 2560 x 2560 pixels large @ 300 dpi, this is of course the tiny-I-shrank-it-for-web-use-sized one.. <del>Feel free to click it for a larger version (i.e. larger than what your watching right now..)</del>

Enjoy!
