excerpt: Ranting about how horrible The Simpsons Game is.
---
Yes I've resumed playing The Simpsons Game on Xbox 360. And I still don't like it, the camera system suck Japanese penis! But what can you do when you're and achievement whore like me, I faced with a couple of hours of sucking it up and just playing through the damn thing.

Yes, I was playing Assassin's Creed earlier and I'm still not done with that game, but when the last flag in Damascus glitched out on me, I thought to myself "fuck it!". And I decided to take a break from AC. But I'm very hopeful for Assassin's Creed II, it looks to be way better than the first one, and I did/do still like the first one. Over 'n out, I'm going to continue with Simpsons now.
