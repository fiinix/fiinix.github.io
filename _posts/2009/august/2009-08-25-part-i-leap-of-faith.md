...is now finally on youtube, it only took me like 5 hours to get there.. well I guess that's what you get when you try to upload a 1.17 Gb live video. Even though it's only 4 minutes 42 seconds long.

I'm already uploading the next one, and as it's only 465 Mb so it should be available in about an hour and a half.

Enjoy!
