Sorry for the lack of updates. I just had too many things to do lately. Had to move because of impending renovation in our old apartment building. So new home. Also new job. Or well before that I was actually unemployed for 6 months. But a job nonetheless. I am liking it a lot. And of course some freelance work coming my way, not to mention that I still want to spend some time with my family as well.

Much to do...

Also I have a fetish with making pastry-dish's at the moment, will update next time when I have an awesome recipe to share. But not quite yet.
