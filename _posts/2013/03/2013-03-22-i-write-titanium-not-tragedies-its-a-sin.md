excerpt: "In which I finally manage to record and upload a couple of songs."
---
I've finally managed to record a couple of songs and then I also "discovered" a demo song I recorded back when I did The Sittingbourne Sessions that I hadn't uploaded. So I sort of, kind of, "mashed" together the titles of "I Write Sins Not Tragedies" and "Titanium" but I didn't actually mash the songs together. I did however do a little — and horrible — beat-boxing in between the songs. The other song is just a rough demo of a song I'm still writing but I recorded a demo of it back in May, 2012 despite its unfinished state.

I'm sorry for the low volume. I'm still trying to figure out what the hell I'm doing with my recording equipment and well… I haven't quite figured it out yet.

So, after the jump. A few songs to brighten — or ruin, depending on your viewpoint — your weekend.

I Write Titanium, Not Tragedies (It's A Sin).

Oh, right. Also the demo song is in Swedish because I don't usually write Swedish songs and thought it would be fun to try. Maybe I should write some translated closed captions for it?
