“Apparently” some readers where disappointed by my [“Living From A Suitcase”](/blog/living-from-a-suitcase) post. “Apparently” I didn’t divulge enough information. “Apparently” some people are just never happy. But one aims to please, so here I am again.
 
Last year, on the 14th of May, our family of three took our saving of £1255, packed a bag each, to move 1814 km from Finland to England. This is what I packed in my bag.

And in a few weeks we’re going back to Finland to visit friends and family. But since we’re of course not moving like we did last time I figured I can probably get away with packing even lighter. So, having ordered two cabin bags from Ebay — one for me and one the missus — that arrived yesterday, I think it’s only fitting that I write down what I plan on taking with me for our two week stay in Finland.

## Apparel

- 2 Trousers
- 4 Pair of Black Socks
- 3 T-Shirts
- 4 Boxer Briefs
- 1 Sweater

## Coffee

- Zassenhaus Brasilia Burr Grinder
- Not a Bodum Brazil (the beaker has cracked so I need to get that replaced)


## Miscellaneous

- HTC One S
- Wallet, ID, bank card, money

I feel like I might be forgetting something though. Yes? No?
