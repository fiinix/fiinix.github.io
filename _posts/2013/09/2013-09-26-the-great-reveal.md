excerpt: "In which I keep one of the many promises and actually reveal the plans for my upcoming book."
---
I should really never promise anything because in the history of promising things, I’m not good at keeping those promises. We all remember that “Christmas song” I started writing that then turned into an “Easter song” as time went by. Only to vanish into thin air, never to be spoken of again.

Well. For once — much thanks to <a href="http://benjaminhorn.se/" >beije</a> for reviewing my code, my <a href="http://creationsimaginationsofaredridinghood.blogspot.co.uk/" >wife</a> for excusing my absent-mindedness all day and all my co-workers who did reluctant A/B testing — I managed to keep a promise I made.

Last time, in [The Creative Abominable Update](/blog/the-abominable-creative-update), I promised that “all would be revealed” about my book project but of course I didn’t think of how little time there was until the 26th of September. Despite me stressing all week it was almost looking like this was going to be another one of those “promises not kept”.

And because I’ve been sitting at the computer all day, first at work and after that trying frantically to fulfil my promise today I feel like my eyes are going to pop out. So instead of a long post about the making of the website — I’ll hopefully get to that some other day — I’ll just leave [this link here](http://carloseriksson.com/a-rainy-night-on-drury-lane/). You know, just casually.

Go, check it out. Maybe you haven’t read the parts I’ve already written? Maybe you’ve been holding out, waiting and hoping that I would make it into a book. Well, your dreams have been answered.

You're welcome.
