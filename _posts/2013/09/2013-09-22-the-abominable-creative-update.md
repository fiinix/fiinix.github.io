No. Don’t. Turn away. Please for once heed my warnings and…

Never mind. Go on, you know you want to.

This week I’ve been so creative that I’m going to give myself a break by not writing much more than some short paragraphs in this weeks abominable _creative_ update.

Tomorrow, I will have officially not smoked for 365 days. Which is a year if you’re the kind of person who counts things in that way. In — somewhat early — celebration of that I treated myself to something awesome earlier this week.

Yes. I bought myself some Lego. And it’s all for me. But not just any old lego, no Sir. I ordered <a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/The-DeLorean-time-machine-21103?_requestid=889930" >The DeLorean Time Machine</a> because I’m really a small child trapped in man’s body.

And then I got creative.

What do you think? The likeness isn’t exact, obviously… but they’re pretty decent, aren’t they? 

This weekend was also my wonderful wife’s birthday which I naturally remembered in good time to prepare for. I’m not kidding. I remember anniversaries and important dates without any kind of difficulties. Just don’t ask me which years she’s born. Years is where I stumble, fall and crack my skull open.

And since she made me an [beautifully delicious cake](/blog/let-them-eat-cake) I thought I should return the favour. So I asked her what kind of cake she would like and her answer was an unsurprising “Chocolate”. Her wish is of course my command and thanks to a co-worker I had a good base — <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/easy_chocolate_cake_31070" >Easy Chocolate Cake</a> — to start with. Which I consequently “ruined” with Oreo cookies and copious amounts of vanilla buttercream.

This thing would give Willy Wonka diabetes.
