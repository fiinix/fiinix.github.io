5 days until Christmas. The countdown continues.

You know what I think you deserve after all those baking preparations you did yesterday?

Some limericks, that’s what.

Yeah, I know I know, you’re just lost for words from how blessed and special you feel in receiving this awesome gift. No, save your gratitude for later, I might need a kidney some day.

For those of you that don’t know what a limerick is, here’s a limerick that explains what a limerick is:

    Writing a Limerick's absurd,
    Line one and line five rhyme in word,
    And just as you've reckoned
    They rhyme with the second;
    The fourth line must rhyme with the third.

Clever, right? Well, now that you know what I limerick is, let’s get right to a Christmas one so that this post will have a tangent with the overarching Christmas countdown.


    When Rudolph got hurt in a fight
    He couldn't lead Santa that night
    Too much Christmas cheer
    And eggnog, and beer,
    His red nose was shiny, all right!

I’ve only written a limerick once before—back in school—and it wasn’t very good, I imagine since I can’t remember it, so bear with me as I try to summarize “The 12 days of Christmas” into a short limerick.

    My true love to me gave
    Birds that I first had to shave,
    Pluck, stuff and bake.
    Into one giant cake
    That I then ate

No post about limericks would be complete without the classic, “There once was a man from Nantucket”, so here’s the most offensive one I could find.

    There once was a man from Nantucket
    Whose dick was so long he could suck it.
    And he said with a grin
    As he wiped off his chin,
    “If my ear were a cunt, I would fuck it.”
