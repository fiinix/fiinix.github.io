13 days until Christmas. The countdown continues.

In two days we’re going to celebrate Saint Lucia’s Day. For those of you who have no idea what that is, don’t worry, I’ll explain in all in due—in two days—time. In the meantime you need to get your ass to the store to pick up some supplies, you’re going to be baking buns soon enough and you’ll need some saffron.

Also, read the recipe properly, I’ve made some important notices where necessary.

## Saffron buns

Makes 24 buns.

    (1)
    125 g butter
    300 ml milk
    1 g saffron
    50 g baker's yeast
    
    (2)
    150 g sugar
    700 g all-purpose flour
    
    (3)
    raisins
    
    (4)
    salt
    1 egg
    

### Directions

(1) Melt butter or margarine <mark>But don’t use margarine, it sucks</mark> in a pan and add the milk and the saffron.

Warm the mixture to 37 °C using a thermometer, getting the correct temperature is important for a good rise. <mark>Also, you don’t want to kill the yeast, you murderer.</mark>

Pour the mixture over the _finely_ <mark>but really, who are we kidding</mark> divided yeast; then add the remaining ingredients (2).

Mix into a smooth dough.

Cover the dough with a piece of cloth and let it rise for 30 minutes.

Knead <mark>Knead like your life depends on it</mark> the dough, divide it into 25-30 pieces and form each piece into a round bun.

Let the buns rest for a few minutes, covered by a piece of cloth.

Form each bun into a string, 15-20 cm long, then arrange the string to a suitable shape, making sure the ends of the strings meet. <mark>The “S” shapes is a classic, for a reason. Don’t try to mix it up with some other “lesser” letter.</mark>

(3) Press a few raisins <mark>I honestly hate raisins but in these I’ll let that slide</mark> into the dough.

Cover the buns with a piece of cloth and let them rise for 40 minutes.

(4) Whip the egg together with a few grains of salt, and paint the buns with the mixture.

Bake them for 5-10 minutes in the oven at 250 <span>°</span>C until golden brownish yellow.

Take out, let cool <mark>and shove them into your talking hole.</mark> Enjoy.
