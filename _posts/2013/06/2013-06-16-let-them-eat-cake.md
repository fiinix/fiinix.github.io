excerpt: "In which I show you the actual cake with 29 individual candles. Fire hazards ignored."

I once knew a woman who said “Let them eat cake!” or something like that. Actually I didn’t know her, it was Marie Antoinette whom as we all know didn’t live when I lived. I live now and she’s… well… pretty dead last time I checked. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_them_eat_cake" >She also never actually said “Let them eat cake!”</a>.

So all of that were lies. Delicious lies. Except for the cake part. There is cake, would you like to see it?
  
So yeah. Now I’m officially older than I was yesterday. Though to be fair, I am going to be older than I am today tomorrow. And so on and so forth. I don’t feel particularly wiser but I do feel older. Waking up this morning was quite a shock to the — my — system as it dawned on me that “Woe is me, I’m so old!”

How old am I? I woke up this morning with a blistering migraine but not because I had been out the night before, partying like the animal I could be. No, I had a migraine because I had forgotten to drink a sufficient amount of water yesterday, like the drying up walking corpse that I actually am. So I have resigned to being older than I would like to be, as we all inevitably have to at one point or another.

Still not going to ze gym though.

Yesterday I made a grandiose promise that there would be cake. Well, for me at least. I never — technically — promised you any cake at all. But I feel like I boasted quite a lot about this awesome cake to be, with its 29 candles, so I thought I should at the very least give you a picture of it. The packaging said to place each candle 10 cm apart from the next one.

"Bah! Humbug!" I say. "Fire hazard, my ass!"
