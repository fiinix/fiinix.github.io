excerpt: "In which beije and make a game called Monorun! that is now also available on Windows Phone."

Our minimalistic game about the transience of life returns as beije develops it into a native game for the Windows Phone.
 
A few months ago beije and I made a small browser game called <a href="http://monorun.com/" >Monorun!</a> It’s a delightful and unforgiving game that will only take ~17 seconds — on average — of your life to try. In fact, if you haven’t already given it a try you should go and do that right now. Just go, <a href="http://monorun.com/" >try it</a> and then come back to read the rest of this post. Like I said, it only takes ~17 seconds before you’ll meet your inevitable demise.

Don’t worry, I’ll wait.

Pretty delightful, right?

I would love to say that it was an enormous success and we became filthy rich. Filthy rich I tell you! But that didn’t happen. To be fair though, it’s not something we were aiming for. Our only goal was to design and develop a “fun” little with a limited time-scale — about 4 weeks from idea to Release Candidate 1 — and to make its <a href="https://github.com/beije/monorun" >source available on github.com</a>.

If — on the side of these goals — the game would happen to become a moderate success, well, we would consider that a bonus.

I was looking forward to writing the post you’re reading.

I was really looking forward to designing all kinds of informative and pretty infographics but the more I looked at the statistics we had, the more I came to the conclusion that I shouldn’t. The data we had didn’t really warrant infographics in that way and I couldn’t justify designing infographics whose only purpose was to look pretty.

So I’m going to have another look at it before I post anything. In the meantime — if you have a Windows Phone — beije went and <a href="http://www.benjaminhorn.se/code/monorun-for-windows-phone/" >developed a version of Monorun! for Windows Phone</a> and you should <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/monorun/83ba4853-8797-407f-851a-588217fc5b2d" >download it right here</a>. Go! Do it, like it, share it, play it and then tell us what you think by leaving a comment down below or writing a review in the Windows Phone Store.
