I hope you weren’t eagerly awaiting a post back when I was in Finland because as I’m sure you could can figure out, I was busy doing stuff. Not just any kind of stuff either but important stuff.

Yeah.

Let’s go with that. Important stuff.

No? No one believes that even for a second? Fine.

If I **had** written a post back when we were still in Finland — who knows, maybe I tried? — it might have looked a bit like this;

*We finally of course made it to Finland — [as anyone who follows me on Twitter can attest to](https://twitter.com/fiinixdesign/status/365610953486123008) — and as I’m sitting here, in what used to be my childhood room, I’m trying my best to not sound like Carrie from Sex And The City… but it’s difficult.*

*Not because I want to sound like her but for some reason my blog writing inner monologue voice is that… of a New York woman in her mid-thirties.*  

*Yeah, I don’t know why either but it’s been like this for years already and well… there’s no point is stopping now.* 

*I can still remember this room very clearly because there’s another room right next to it that wasn’t mine — not at first at least — but that had the unfortunate luck of sharing the same door as mine, which meant every time someone wanted to go to the other room, they had to go through mine.*

But as we all know I didn’t write anything during our stay and rather than try to explain in words all the experiences I had I thought I would do the only reasonable thing and show you, with pictures.

So without further ado, I give you The Re-Return Tour Of 2013 Collage. For extra fun, see if you can spot all the different pop-culture references that I have put into the captions.
