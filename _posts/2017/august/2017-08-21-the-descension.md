Some times we fall.

Last year, because of everything that happened and was happening I started smoking again.

*Gasp!*

I know, I know.

For 4 years I had managed to be smoke-free. I had managed to reduce my risk of coronary heart disease by half. I had managed to start running, eating healthier and feeling more like my authentic self.

*Patient is white male in early thirties, appearing in good health.*

But some times we fall.

And I have fallen.

Now I could blame it all on stress and the clusterfuck that is life. But, whilst there's certainly an element of stress in there, the truth is that there's an underlying reason for me starting to smoke again.

I've already talked about [how unhappy I've been with how I look][vanity].

And I've been thinking a lot about what happiness means to me---I'm going to talk more about it in a future entry.

Happiness isn't just about how I look.

It's about how I feel, how I perceive myself and how I perceive myself in relationship to other people.

I went for a run this morning.

For the past few months I've noticed what I can only describe as, "getting a lot shittier at running."

*Patient is presenting with a steady decline in respiratory performance.*

When [running the 5k Colour Dash last week][dash], I struggled to keep you with Ben and felt out of breath for most of the run.

*Patient is presenting with elevated carbon monoxide levels.*

I ran a half marathon earlier this year and struggled a lot less running for 2 hours straight.

***

I didn't start smoking again because I was stressed.

I continue to smoke because I'm stressed.

But I started again because deep dǝǝp **dǝǝp** inside I felt unloved for who I am.

I felt as if the person I am, my authentic self wasn't worthy of love.x

> My authenthic self is worthy of love. I am worthy of love. I am not my father.

> Mend the bonds, torn by pride
