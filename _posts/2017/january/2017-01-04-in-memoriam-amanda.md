My training starts today.

In two months I'm going to run the [Saucony Cambridge Half Marathon][marathon].

So far, I've only run 5K and a 2.8 km relay-race so at 21.4 km, a half marathon is going to be my new longest race.

I've given in to the idea, that I, in fact, do enjoy running.

My mind enjoys running. I feel a meditative calm as my feet rhythmically hit the pavement and I am forced to focus on my breathing.

I need to calm my mind. To still the shouting.

Amanda and I used to go out for hour-long walks together, talking about everything and anything we came to think of. It used to calm my mind. She used to calm my mind.

I want to honour her somehow.

I haven't just lost a person at one point in time.

I've lost---

---we've lost a presence in every aspect of our lives. Our present and future has changed forever.

***

I want [her death][sleep] to have as much of a positive impact, as her life did.

***

Which is why my training starts today.

Which is why, a year after her death I'm going calm my mind by running the Saucony Cambridge Half Marathon and [raise money for cancer research][donate].

Because I fucking hate cancer.

Fuck cancer.

Starting today I'm going to do the first of my 32 runs leading up to [the big day][fb-event] when I hope to run 21.4 km in 2 hours or less---2:19:45 is my estimated finish time.

I have a [fundraising page on Just Giving][donate] and as my training and preparation progresses I plan on updating this page frequently.

If all goes well those 32 runs will have amounted to a total of 262 km before my half marathon.

If all goes well, I should be ready to run my half marathon by then.

However it goes, I'm giving this year purpose.

I'm making it count.

And I'm inviting you to follow along as I give this year purpose.
