After the colourful wake-up call that was the [Ely Colour Dash][colour] a few weeks ago---where I struggled to run a leisurely 5k---I was eager to see what difference not smoking would make.

I haven't smoked since I [realised why I actually smoked in the first place][descension].

A couple of days after quitting I could already tell the difference.

And after a few weeks the feeling of impending death as I ran had significantly decreased.

I could breath again.

My pace had increased, from the meager 05:55 min/km during a 5k, to a more majestic 04:55 min/km during a 10k run.

I was ready for the next obstacle race.

***

The event, [Go Insane][insane], organised by Insane Terrain Running was a 5k course with obstacles such as wading in water, climbing over a pyramid of hay bales and sliding through mud.

Scott and I had signed up a few weeks earlier and we had both been training to get ready for it.

By the time I had finished the course I was having so much fun that I decided to run it again, bringing my total to 10k.

*Again, I'm so sorry for mocking people who ran.*

<p data-pullquote="I had promised my coworkers I would retire the shoes after the obstacle race."></p>

And aside for running my longest obstacle race to date I also decided to record my run using a borrowed GoPro Hero 4.

Now, I've never used a GoPro before and in hindsight I really should have checked that the horizon was level before I started running.

But I didn't.

Oh well.

Despite this I think the footage came out better than I had expected.

After the race it was time I retired my running shoes.

They had served me well.

I had gotten the Saucony Swerve last January, in [preparation for the Cambridge Half][preparing], and I should have probably retired them a long time ago.

That, and I had promised my coworkers I would retire the shoes after the obstacle race---as they rightfully keep pointing out---my toes were, after all, sticking out of both shoes.

Retiring them also meant getting new shoes.

For a while now I've been thinking about natural running and being able to run barefeet.

So I'm now breaking in my new Altra Lone Peak 3.5 zero drop shoes---I'll let you know what I think of them once I had a few runs in them---and getting ready for the next event.

Next up, something much worse.
