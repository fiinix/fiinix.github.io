Things have been pretty serious lately, don't you think?

I think so.

For good reasons--- well not *good*, but you get the idea.

So with that in mind, I think it's time we do something a little more casual.

## Sudden Double what?

[Sudden Double Deep][itunes] is a triple bill title podcast where real-life friends Ben and Daryl watch 3 films linked by a word in the title and then get together to talk about those films, and the hilariously tenuous links that bind them.

In their most recent episode **022 FORCE**, they take it to the limit with Dirty Harry in Magnum Force (1973), help Chuck Norris thwart a hijacking with The Delta Force (1986) and struggle through an aching awkwardness in Force Majeure (2014).

Before that, in episode **021 SINGLE**, they move in with a lovely new flatmate in Single White Female (1993), suffer a profound loss in A Single Man (2010) and sit through a venomous piece of trash with How To Be Single (2016).

The podcast is a well-blended mixture between, friends having a humorous chat in a pub, and insightful analysis of films themselves, including the clich√©s and tropes they employ.

My favourite thing about it though, is that I often find myself wanting to watch a film that, before the episode, I hadn't even heard of.

And that's not something I can say about a lot of podcasts of review websites.

And with Sudden Double Deep coming to the end of their first season, you've got [plenty of episodes to enjoy!][itunes]
