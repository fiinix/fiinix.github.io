Now I'm not a big believer in pigeon-holing people.

I'd like to think that the complexity of human emotion, compassion and interaction can't be condensed into a four-letter acronym.

But as the test results later showed, I'm exactly the kind of person to think that.

The NERIS Type Explorer® builds on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®) authored by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers in the 1920s.

Their work in turn builds on the father of analytical psychology, Carl Gustav Jung, and his theory of psychological types which dates back to early 20th century.

As an aside, I remember completing the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator over a decade ago and the results were pretty much the same back then. So much for personal growth ey?

For the sake of transparency I have copied [the introduction to the ENFP personality][enfp] verbatim, adding my own notes as <mark>highlights</mark>.

The result itself comes with seven more sections, ranging from Strength and Weaknesses to Workplace habits and it's a quite interesting read---though you should probably take the test instead to find out which pigeon-hole you fit into.

## The Campaigner (ENFP-T)

> It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for – and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart’s longing. It doesn’t interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool – for love – for your dreams – for the adventure of being alive. <mark>I already love this quote</mark> <cite>Oriah Mountain Dreamer</cite>

The ENFP personality is a true free spirit. <mark>I'm like a bird ♪♫♬</mark> They are often the life of the party, but unlike Explorers, they are less interested in the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment than they are in enjoying the social and emotional connections they make with others. Charming <mark>Why yes I am</mark>, independent, energetic and compassionate, the 7% of the population <mark>Well yeah, 16 divided by 100. I'm not that fucking special am I?</mark> that they comprise can certainly be felt in any crowd.

### You can change the world with just an idea

More than just sociable people-pleasers <mark>Always the people, never the pleaser</mark> though, ENFPs, like all their Diplomat cousins, are shaped by their Intuitive (N) quality, allowing them to read between the lines with curiosity and energy.

They tend to see life as a big, complex puzzle where everything is connected <mark>I keep telling you it is!</mark> – but unlike Analysts, who tend to see that puzzle as a series of systemic machinations, ENFPs see it through a prism of emotion, compassion and mysticism, and are always looking <mark>Asking, 'Why,' is always more interesting</mark> for a deeper meaning.

<p data-pullquote="As I stand by my conviction—if the avian orifice fits."></p>

ENFPs are fiercely independent, and much more than stability and security, they crave creativity and freedom <mark>Guilty!</mark>.

Many other types are likely to find these qualities irresistible, and if they’ve found a cause that sparks their imagination, ENFPs will bring an energy that oftentimes thrusts them into the spotlight, held up by their peers as a leader and a guru – but this isn’t always where independence-loving ENFPs want to be <mark>This actually explains a lot</mark>. Worse still if they find themselves beset by the administrative tasks and routine maintenance <mark>Ugh, fucking administrative tasks</mark> that can accompany a leadership position. ENFPs’ self-esteem is dependent on their ability to come up with original solutions, and they need to know that they have the freedom to be innovative – they can quickly lose patience or become dejected if they get trapped in a boring role.

### Don’t lose that ’little spark of madness’

Luckily, ENFPs know how to relax <mark>I do?</mark>, and they are perfectly capable of switching from a passionate, driven idealist in the workplace to that imaginative and enthusiastic free spirit on the dance floor <mark>Shake it like you mean it baby!</mark>, often with a suddenness that can surprise even their closest friends. Being in the mix also gives them a chance to connect emotionally with others, giving them cherished insight into what motivates their friends and colleagues. They believe that everyone should take the time <mark>Because they should</mark> to recognize and express their feelings, and their empathy and sociability make that a natural conversation topic.

The ENFP personality type needs to be careful, however – if they rely too much on their intuition, assume or anticipate too much about a friend’s motivations, they can misread the signals and frustrate plans that a more straightforward approach would have made simple <mark>Damn it</mark>. This kind of social stress is the bugbear that keeps harmony-focused Diplomats awake at night. ENFPs are very emotional and sensitive, and when they step on someone’s toes, they both feel it <mark>I wonder if my mom is an ENFP too?</mark>.

ENFPs will spend a lot of time exploring social relationships, feelings and ideas before they find something that really rings true. But when they finally do find their place in the world, their imagination, empathy and courage are likely to produce incredible results <mark>Coincidentally I think I've found it recently</mark>.

Like I said, I'm not a big believer in pigeon-holing people.

And as much as I stand by my conviction---if the avian orifice fits.

The test, which is free and takes less than 12 minutes might ring true for you too. What are you waiting for?
