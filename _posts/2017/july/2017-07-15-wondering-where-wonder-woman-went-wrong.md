I recently went to the cinema and saw the latest effort in DC Comics' attempt to catch up with the behemoth that is Marvel.

DC Comics' Wonder Woman gets the award for managing to be the fifth[^1] feature film with a leading female superhero. Imagine that, we're in 2017 and this is only the fifth.

But, I'm conflicted in my opinions of Wonder Woman.

Because there's at least two perspectives from which one can approach this film and rather than picking one over the other, I'm going to do both.

## Act 1: Bound through blood

The film opens with present-day Diana (Gal Gadot) receiving a delivery from Wayne Enterprises, leading to Diana having a flashback of her childhood on the island Themyscira, where she escapes her tutor to watch her fellow Amazons in combat training.

Despite her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) forbidding her, Diana soon starts training with her aunt, general Antiope (Robin Wright) to be the strongest of all of them.

It continues as World War I pilot and spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) and his plane crashes on Themyscira, inadvertently bringing German forces with him and causing the first battle where we are given proof of the formidable nature of the Amazons, as the German bullets are no match for their superior archery skills.

But general Antiope, taking a bullet to prevent Diana from finding out her true nature, dies.

slays us with her superior archery skills, she dies.

As Diana is about to leave, her mother Queen Hippolyta (), catches them on the shore about to set sail. Where instead of the partiarchical, "You're not going. Obey me," we're instead treated to a very emotional and empathic scence where her mother understands she can't stop her and express it, in words, adding that the world of Men, "don't deserve you."

Soon, Diana leaves the island to try and stop the war, marking the beginning of her transformation into Wonder Woman.

This is later echoed as Steve Trevor's superiours give him the standard, "Do as we say," bullshit

I can't fault the first act for anything.

Having two The director Patty Jenkins handles both flashback sequences without a lingering on either needlessly.

## Act 2: The woman who entered No Man's Land

Apparently Patty Jenkins had to fight Warner Bros. to keep, what is arguably on of the best sequences, in the film.

> I think that in superhero movies, they fight other people, they fight villains. So when I started to really hunker in on the significance of No Man's Land, there were a couple people who were deeply confused, wondering, like, 'Well, what is she going to do? How many bullets can she fight?' And I kept saying, 'It's not about that. This is a different scene than that. This is a scene about her becoming Wonder Woman.' <cite>Patty Jenkins</cite>

Boy am I glad she got her will through.

The entire sequence is amazing.

From the build-up, with Steve recruiting Sameer (Saïd Taghmaoui) and Charlie (Ewen Bremner) in a local pub, who misjudge Diana as a damsel they will need to keep safe; Summarised in Charlie's sentence, <q>Listen sweetheart, I'm not gonna get myself killed helping a wee lass out of a ditch.</q>

To the fight scene itself with Diana storming the German side of No Man's Land, shielding herself from the ensuing bullet storm and then leaping into the trenches, taking out the soldiers only to continue to the occupied Belgian town of Veld to save the civilians there.

Where she proceeds to take out a German sniper from a church tower by, well... jumping off a makeshift shield and literally tackling the church tower, reducing it to rubble.   

The misjudgement is later echoed when Sameer, Charlie and The Chief---who they met up with after the pub---are given the opportunity to end their journey in Veld, having held their end of the deal but instead express their concern for Steve's ability to take care of himself, having now witnessed that Diana is the more capable of the two.

## Act 3: The moustached myth emerges

And we finally come the somewhat troubled third act.

The final showdown.

Now setting aside my complete lack of surprise on the reveal---the second I saw sldgjhsj (played by adf ds) I thought to myself, "He's the bad guy."

<p data-pullquote="The God of War himself, has the presence of lukewarm British pudding."></p>

His cane and weaknesssss an obvious red herring.

My biggest problem with casting jsgksfjg is that whilst he plays the British aristocrat flawlessly he's lacks the potency and terrifying demour that I want from Ares,the God of War of himself.

In some respects, his unassuming portayal works as it's intended---the idea being that the God of War merely nudges people to commit atrocities but doesn't actually create them himself. But it comes at the price of having a final showdown where the God of War himself, has the presence of lukewarm British pudding.

A more ambigous actor, someone capable of walking both lines would have worked better for me.

Case in point, The Mandarin/Trevor Slattery (played by Ben Kingsley) in Iron Man 3. Althouugh the twist was a reversal, where we're led to believe he is the bad guy when in actuality he's merely a distraction, Ben Kingsley managed to play both parts to hair-raising perfection and steals every scene he's in.

## The wonder

Jenkins, has set the bar high, managing on a lesser budget than her peers--another testament to the ineqality of this world---to create something greater than sdondrhsfg. Something DC Comics' had failed to do until then.

As a superhero film, Wonder Woman is only pretty decent.

Wonder Woman beat out the openings of the first two Thor and Captain America movies, as well as the first Iron Man ($98.6 million)

It doesn't hold its own against the best of Marvel but having said that, it's by far the best from DC Comics so far.

As the first, well marketed, portayal of woman unapolegtically kicking ass and pawing the way for more representation for women, Wonder Woman is pretty fucking fantastic.

I look forward to seeing Jenkins get the budget and say she should have in the first place to return for a Wonder Woman sequel.
