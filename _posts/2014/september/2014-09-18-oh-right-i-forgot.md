excerpt: In which I remember about the short interview, in which the question "Who the hell is Carlos Eriksson?" finally gets an answer.

Talk about showing up late to the party.

There's fashionably late and then there's "I completely forgot about it for a month" late.

This is more the latter.

Last month, Kris asked me to write a short article answering some questions he had sent me, to introduce me to their <del>billions</del> <del>millions</del> <ins>handful</ins> of readers.

But rather than copying and pasting the article here I'm going to do the adult thing and link to it instead. [Read Meet frontend developer Carlos Eriksson][squider]. I especially enjoyed pretentiously posing and pretending to read. Though in hindsight I wish I would have turned the book upside down as an Easter egg for those with a keen eye.

And for those of you who are even more curios, I'm by the way pretending---don't worry, I have read it---to read the excellent [Design Is a Job][book] by Mike Monteiro.
