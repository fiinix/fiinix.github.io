excerpt: In which I provide a solution to the problem of not being able to scroll the viewport on touch devices because I'm stuck inside a stupid map that is covering the entire viewport.
---
You know what I'm talking about.

There I am, sitting on the toilet and pooping whilst surfing Facebook from my phone when suddenly; I'm browsing a website for information and it has a map embedded on it. This website also happens to be responsive which is nice because as you might recall, I'm browsing it from my phone.

And then it happens.

I reach the map and being responsive it spans the entire width---and most of the height---of the viewport.

That's it, I'm stuck.

I might as well settle down, build a house and wait for death, because from now on I'm forever stuck panning around the Pacific Ocean, never reaching the website's footer and its allusive email address.

That is, unless I can somehow---using my fat stupid fingers---find a small crevice where the map doesn't reach so I can scroll down the rest of the page. Which is a terrible <del>user</del> visitor experience.

So, can we make this better?

##The idea

The idea itself is quite simple.

We'll overlay a `::before` pseudo-element on top of the map. It will receive our click/touch events instead of the map, which means we'll be free to scroll without interacting with the map itself. Using a button we can then toggle to remove the overlay, letting the map receive our click/touch events again.

</figure>

This is what our <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> markup is going to be like:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="map-container">
	<!-- Google embed code (iframe) here -->
	<button>Toggle</button>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

But because we want our `iframe` to be fluid rather than fixed and still *have to* provide it with an actual width and height in the markup---otherwise it defaults to 300 Ã— 150 px---we're going to have to have to come up with a different way to get it fluid.

Cue [intrinsic ratios][alist], which allows browsers to determine the iframe's dimensions based on the width of its containing block. In our case that's going to be `100%` and by adjusting the `padding-bottom` we can change the aspect ratio to always be appropriately sized for any device. Whether that's 16:9, 4:3, or something else.

Intrinsic ratios uses `position: absolute` to position the `iframe` though, which means our overlay is now behind our map.

By changing the stacking order, like in the example below, we can get our elements back in the correct z-order.

{% highlight css %}
/* Illustrative code to show the stacking order */

.map {
	z-index: 1;
}
.overlay {
	z-index: 2;
}
.button {
	z-index: 3;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Our button only needs to take care of toggling a couple of class names, one on the map container and another one for the button itself. The <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> takes care of the rest.

By changing our `::before` pseudo-element's `pointer-events` value from `auto` to `none` we can tell our overlay layer to *not* receive our click/touch events. This will then go to the element "underneath" it, which thanks to our revised stacking order is the `.map` layer.

##The result

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="8619" data-slug-hash="zdBue" data-default-tab="result" data-user="fiinix" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/fiinix/pen/zdBue/'>Better Map Experience for Touch Devices</a> by fiinix (<a href='http://codepen.io/fiinix'>@fiinix</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

And there we have it. Instead of getting stuck inside a map when scrolling the viewport your visitors can now enjoy a less frustrating browsing experience.

I encourage you to have a [play with it and improve it][codepen]. As you can see, I've kept the styling to a minimum, i.e. browser defaults <abbr title="for the win">ftw</abbr>, because I don't want to burden you with my opinions on aesthetic choices.

By the way, we could use the [Google Maps API][api] for the map but a more straightforward approach---as we don't need to deal with API keys---is to use their own embed code, which is why, for the purpose of this demo, that's what I had chosen. I'm not saying it's better, just easier.

And although our solution is primarily meant to solve a difficult interaction problem on touch devices---where screen real estate is precious---it will work just as well on non-touch devices, including being accessible for keyboard-only visitors because we're using an actual `<button>` element to handle the toggle event.

##The limitations

The demo relies on jQuery but you could rewrite it using pure Javascript as well, using `querySelector` and `addEventListener` to toggle the class name but I won't go into that here---mostly because I haven't looked into a good way of replicating jQuery's `.toggleClass()` yet.

The demo also only supports <abbr title="Internet Explorer 11">IE11</abbr> because it's the only <abbr>IE</abbr> browser with support for <abbr>CSS</abbr> `pointer-events`. In production code  you might need to support as far back as <abbr>IE9</abbr> for which I would recommend using jQuery's---or a pure Javascript equivalent---`.fadeToggle()` instead, otherwise you end up with our overlay layer still receiving the click events regardless of its opacity.

Alternately you could simply set `display: none` on the map container when it's active but at the cost of losing any transition effects.
