I think that title should be a white card in the party game [Cards Against Humanity][cah].

## Cupcakes

Remember all those [cupcakes I baked last year][cupcakes]? What started out as a way to alleviate boredom and still my insatiable appetite---pun intended---to try new things, turned into 7 spectastacularly---If Shakespeare could make up words, then so can I---different cupcakes, much to the delight of my co-workers.

But---because there's always a butt.

In all of these delicious experiments, there was one batch that got the best of me. The curd just wouldn't set. The Swiss meringue was sloppy and wet.

You could have called it, "The one that got away," had it not been for my persistence and reluctance to give up. That, and it pissed me off that I couldn't make some pesky Pineapple curd.

Which is why I promised myself that I would revisit the cupcake-experiments at a later date. And seeing as this week was my last week at Sitewizard I thought it only fitting that the co-workers who had been forced to endure my first 7 cupcakes, would have to endure my last cupcakes as well.

Cue the---

I suppose it's good to know that I have an alternative career to fall back on if this *web design thing* doesn't pan out.

## From wizards to squids

As my last week at [Sitewizard Ltd][sitewizard] drew to its close I started reflecting more and more on whether or not I *had actually* learned anything during my time there. The answer was, of course, yes. Yes I have. I would be a narcissist to think otherwise.

*Everything I have learned, both personally and professionally, I will take with me and whilst the lessons have not always been fun, they've always been educational. Merci*.

On Monday I will work my last official day at Sitewizard. The following morning I will start the first of many walks to the ridiculously beautiful Turkey Mills---seriously, I'll take some pictures to show you---for my very first day at [Squiders Ltd][squiders].

Kris and Jo---from Squiders---had invited me out, so we could get to know each other better, for introductory drinks last Thursday. This was also my first pub quiz where, so aside for getting to one another better, I also got the opportunity to display my encyclopedic lack-of-knowledge to all questions pertaining sports, current affairs and famous people.

It's a good thing I've already gotten the job.

## Tattoos

And in other news I've also *finally gotten started* on my next and final tattoo. My two main characters will have, hopefully, by the end of the year, grown into the sleeve tattoo that will cover my entire right arm.

And seeing as I already showed you [a sneak preview of the sketch a few months ago][tattoo], I didn't actually end up going to Skin Flix Tattooz as originally planned---They weren't a right fit for me after all---and instead I had my first session with [Jamie over at Stainless Steve's][steve], who will be doing the rest of my arm as well.

Once it's healed I'll give you a look at the result of the first session. Until then, you'll have you to settle for a progress shot.

Although far from complete, my pinstriped groom and his bride is a very good start.
