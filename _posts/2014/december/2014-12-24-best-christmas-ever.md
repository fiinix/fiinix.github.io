excerpt: In which we finally let go of last year's disastrous Christmas and begin to enjoy this year's quite wonderful Christmas.
---
This year's Christmas is the one that counts, because last year's Christmas wasn't much to hang in the proverbial Christmas tree.

The Christmas dinner has been eaten, the gammon was a particular favourite of all of us. The 1958 Walt Disney Presents Christmas special, "From All of Us to All of You" has been watched. Or as we know it better, <em lang="sv">Kalle Anka och hans vänner önskar God Jul</em>. We've danced around the Christmas tree, singing <em lang="sv">Granen står så grön och grann i stugan</em> and other classic songs.

Lucien dressed up as Santa---wearing the beard Rebecka had crocheted for him---and gave out presents and it was the most adorable and hilarious things this year.

He then built the Lego he got whilst Rebecka and I sat down to open the first of my tree small bottles of whisky.

Before I leave you with this year's Christmas card from the Eriksson family I have one last thing to say: Merry Christmas, to all of you, and a good night.
