####Week 0

The date is 9th of November and I'm bored on a Sunday.

So bored, that I decide to grow a beard for a year. Up until this point in my life I've never really been unshaven for longer than two weeks and it's never looked good.

I've also decided to give myself a head start, by not going completely clean shaven. It's not like I've made some masochistic promise to start from zero anyway.

####Week 1 - Itchy Bitchy Tiny Whiny

Oh God, this is so fucking itchy. Itchy when I wake up. Itchy when I go to sleep. I sure hope it's doesn't continue like this because that's going to put the grizzly in Grizzly Carlos.

Oh no, the beard puns have already infected my brain.

####Week 2 - Patchy But Promising

Well this sucks. Growing sucks. Nobody tells you how much the first weeks sucks.

I look like a homeless person, no offence to homeless people, with my patchy and uneven growth.

Here's a joke I found, to cheer myself up.

> Don't listen to the naysayers. Anyone who says your beard makes you look homeless isn't the kind of your person you want in your cardboard box anyway.

####Week 3 - The Length of a Lifetime

This week was a lot easier than the last one. Maybe I'm growing used to the presence of my beard. Or maybe my sense of self-control has matured to a new level of---

"Nah, just kidding. Fuck you," said the beard and starts itching at random intervals.

"Fucking beard."

####Week 4 - Being Beard-man

The itching has finally subsided for real.

But instead I now have to start dealing with the fact that, whatever I ate a few days ago is still lingering around my nostril area today.

Why doesn't anyone tell you that your face will smell like old food?

Soon, I'll have to adopt a secret identity so I can go, "Carlos? Who's that? I'm Beard-man, a completely different person with no affiliation to this 'Carlos' you speak of."

"That smell? Oh yeah, that's me, Beard-man. Who definitely isn't this  'Carlos' guy, who by the way sounds like he smells like strawberries, hopes and dreams."

####Week 5 - Tee Tree Facial Wash

Right, that concludes week 5 and quite frankly, I'm still not sure about this beard thing. I know the plan is to grow my beard for a whole year but I still don't feel like my beard *can* grow enough for me to accomplish that.

Another week before I make a final decision.

Well, I say final but actually I can still change my mind whenever.

On a more positive note though, I've discovered my wife's Tee Tree Facial Wash with Exfoliating action and oh my lord it's awesome. Not just the fact that my beard doesn't smell like food any more but the scrubbing action. Oh, the scrubbing action.

####Week 6 - 46 Weeks To Go

As I finish week 6 I've decided that I will in fact continue with this adventure.

I want to see what becomes of this beard of mine, will it suck indefinitely or will it not?

But the biggest contributor to this decision---and I'm not ashamed to admit it---was when my wife asked me if she had any say in this whole endeavour, to which I replied, "Of course", and she told me that she thought that it actually suited me, which was not something she had anticipated.

So unless she's blatantly lying to stroke my ego---which I hope she isn't---that means I also have her blessing to continue this hairy journey of mine.

####Week 7 - Halo Dick

Another week has gone by and as I exit week 7 I'm left with a feeling of surprise as I discover I can now put my own moustache in my mouth.

But I'm pretty sure I shouldn't.

So, as I continue on my beard journey I now begin to look forward to week 13, which is allegedly supposed to be quite a doozy.

Until then, enjoy a little bit of Halo Dick.

####Week 8 - Where No Beard Has Gone Before

For the first time since I started this experiment in facial hair growth, I have had to trim down the moustache a bit.

Some hairs were getting so long that they started crawling into my mouth, which of course, you already knew but then Rebecka told me that it also started crawling into her nose.

"Enough is enough," I thought and took out the scissor to carefully trim down the bits that were getting long.

####Week 9 - With a Hint of Lemon

Last week I decided that this is the week I start to actually groom this ish-beard of mine. So first thing Monday morning I ordered a beard an moustache comb---which turned out to be the tiniest comb I've ever seen---and a teeny-weeny, 10 ml, bottle of Sicilian Lemon Beard Oil courtesy of The Bearded Man Company.

After I've run out of oil, which should still last me a good month, I thought I'd make my own instead. Cheaper in the long run and I get complete control over the scent.
