####Week 0

The date is 9th of November and I'm bored on a Sunday.

So bored, that I decide to grow a beard for a year. Up until this point in my life I've never really been unshaven for longer than two weeks and it's never looked good.

I've also decided to myself a head start by not going completely clean shaven. It's not like I've made some masochistic promise to start from zero anyway.

####Week 1 - Itchy Bitchy Tiny Whiny

Oh God, this is so fucking itchy. Itchy when I wake up. Itchy when I go to sleep. I sure hope it's doesn't continue like this because that's going to put the grizzly in Grizzly Carlos.

Oh no, the beard puns have already infected my brain.

####Week 2 - Patchy But Promising

Well this sucks. Growing sucks. Nobody tells you how much the first weeks sucks.

I look like a homeless person, no offence to homeless people, with my patchy and uneven growth.

Here's a joke I found, to cheer myself up.

> Don't listen to the naysayers. Anyone who says your beard makes you look homeless isn't the kind of your person you want in your cardboard box anyway.
