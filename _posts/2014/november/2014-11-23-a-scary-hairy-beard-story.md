##Week 0

The date is 9th of November and I'm bored on a Sunday.

So bored, that I decide to grow a beard for a year. Up until this point in my life I've never really been unshaven for longer than two weeks and it's never looked good.

I've also decided to give myself a head start, by not going completely clean shaven. It's not like I've made some masochistic promise to start from zero anyway.

##Week 1 - Itchy Bitchy Tiny Whiny

Oh God, this is so fucking itchy. Itchy when I wake up. Itchy when I go to sleep. I sure hope it's doesn't continue like this because that's going to put the grizzly in Grizzly Carlos.

Oh no, the beard puns have already infected my brain.

##Week 2 - Patchy But Promising

Well this sucks. Growing sucks. Nobody tells you how much the first weeks sucks.

I look like a homeless person, no offence to homeless people, with my patchy and uneven growth.

Here's a joke I found, to cheer myself up.

> Don't listen to the naysayers. Anyone who says your beard makes you look homeless isn't the kind of your person you want in your cardboard box anyway.

##Week 3 - The Length of a Lifetime

This week was a lot easier than the last one. Maybe I'm growing used to the presence of my beard. Or maybe my sense of self-control has matured to a new level of---

"Nah, just kidding. Fuck you," said the beard and starts itching at random intervals.

"Fucking beard."

##Week 4 - Being Beard-man

The itching has finally subsided for real.

But instead I now have to start dealing with the fact that, whatever I ate a few days ago is still lingering around my nostril area today.

Why doesn't anyone tell you that your face will smell like old food?

Soon, I'll have to adopt a secret identity so I can go, "Carlos? Who's that? I'm Beard-man, a completely different person with no affiliation to this 'Carlos' you speak of."

"That smell? Oh yeah, that's me, Beard-man. Who definitely isn't this  'Carlos' guy, who by the way sounds like he smells like strawberries, hopes and dreams."

</figure>

##Week 5 - Tee Tree Facial Wash

Right, that concludes week 5 and quite frankly, I'm still not sure about this beard thing. I know the plan is to grow my beard for a whole year but I still don't feel like my beard *can* grow enough for me to accomplish that.

Another week before I make a final decision.

Well, I say final but actually I can still change my mind whenever.

On a more positive note though, I've discovered my wife's Tee Tree Facial Wash with Exfoliating action and oh my lord it's awesome. Not just the fact that my beard doesn't smell like food any more but the scrubbing action. Oh, the scrubbing action.

##Week 6 - 46 Weeks To Go

As I finish week 6 I've decided that I will in fact continue with this adventure.

I want to see what becomes of this beard of mine, will it suck indefinitely or will it not?

But the biggest contributor to this decision---and I'm not ashamed to admit it---was when my wife asked me if she had any say in this whole endeavour, to which I replied, "Of course", and she told me that she thought that it actually suited me, which was not something she had anticipated.

So unless she's blatantly lying to stroke my ego---which I hope she isn't---that means I also have her blessing to continue this hairy journey of mine.

##Week 7 - Halo Dick

Another week has gone by and as I exit week 7 I'm left with a feeling of surprise as I discover I can now put my own moustache in my mouth.

But I'm pretty sure I shouldn't.

So, as I continue on my beard journey I now begin to look forward to week 13, which is allegedly supposed to be quite a doozy.

Until then, enjoy a little bit of Halo Dick.

##Week 8 - Where No Beard Has Gone Before

For the first time since I started this experiment in facial hair growth, I have had to trim down the moustache a bit.

Some hairs were getting so long that they started crawling into my mouth, which of course, you already knew but then Rebecka told me that it also started crawling into her nose.

"Enough is enough," I thought and took out the scissor to carefully trim down the bits that were getting long.

##Week 9 - With a Hint of Lemon

Last week I decided that this is the week I start to actually groom this ish-beard of mine. So first thing Monday morning I ordered a beard and moustache comb---which turned out to be the tiniest comb I've ever seen---and a teeny-weeny, 10 ml, bottle of Sicilian Lemon Beard Oil courtesy of The Bearded Man Company.

After I've run out of oil, which should still last me a good month, I thought I'd make my own instead. Cheaper in the long run and I get complete control over the scent.

##Week 10 - A Man Bun Appears

I don't really have anything interesting to write about this week. My beard keeps growing---too slowly if you ask me---but there's isn't much I can do about that.

The advice on the internet ranges from "Don't masturbate to keep all your testosterone in your body" to "Buying suspicious 'supplements' for extra manly growth".

For now, I've decided on neither and I'm settling for a disappointed growth instead.

On the other hand, this week I tried to tie a little man bun at the back of my head and well... it looked pretty ridiculous, so there's always that.

##Week 11 - When A Man Loves A Beard

Try to imagine what it might have sounded like if Percy Sledge had loved a beard, instead of a woman.

When a man loves a beard<br>
Can't keep his hands on nothin' else<br>
He'd trade the world<br>
For the good comb an' oil he's found<br>
If it is bad, he can't see it<br>
The beard can do no wrong<br>
Turn his back on his best friend<br>
If the douche puts it down<br>

When a man loves a beard<br>
Spend his very last dime<br>
Trying to ex-foliate regularly<br>
He'd give up all his comforts<br>
And sleep out in the rain<br>
As long as he could cover<br>
The beard appropriately<br>

When a man loves a beard<br>
He gives it everything he's got (yeah)<br>
Trying to hold on<br>
To those precious follicles<br>
Beard please don't treat me bad<br>

When a man loves a beard<br>
Deep down in his soul<br>
It can bring him such masculinity<br>
If he is playing a little football<br>
Or other sports-related activities<br>
The beard and him will kick some ass<br>

Yes when a man loves a beard<br>
I know exactly how he feels<br>
'Cause beard, beard, beard<br>
I am a man<br>
When a man loves a beard <br>

##Week 12 - A Time-Travelling Beard

Right. It's been 12 weeks since I started this hairy, itchy journey of mine and since I've been posting a picture every 4 weeks I thought I could continue that tradition.

	<figcaption>You can call me Mr. Husky MacMan.</figcaption>
</figure>

For the next month we're going to attempt to recreate the hardship, austerity and rationing of living during World War II. Which in any other case would also mean that I would shave everything away, because beards weren't particularly fashionably during World War II.

But, because we've decided to cut ourselves some slack I'm keeping the beard. Besides, growing a beard for a year wouldn't be so much fun if I cut it of after 12 weeks.

##Week 13 - The Hogan

So, is week 13 the doozy I was expecting?

Well, no. But as this stupid thing begins to fill in---fill out?---it's looking less and less patchy, which is nice.

I told you I was going to let my hair grow out as well, didn't I?

I'm going for that Jesus-y look but you can call me Carlos Christ.

##Week 14 - Bored of the Beard

I'm so bored of this now. Not the beard-growing but the weekly updates---if you can call them that?---where I'm supposed to be insightful about growing a beard. Or something like that, to be honest with you, I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to be doing here.

Besides, there's plenty of more eloquent people out there, making videos about their beards. Have you actually looked online? There's a ridiculous amount of videos out there. And I thought I wouldn't add myself to that mix.

Is there anything you'd like to me to talk about?

##Week 15 - White All Over My Face

Even though [we're pretending it's 1943][wartime] and we had agreed to postpone any shrove bun eating until *after* February, my wife still surprised me with making a few buns last Tuesday. Using our rations no less.

Needless to say, I slapped one into my face instantly, devouring it with gusto. It should come as no surprise that my beard is quite the whipped cream magnet and by the end of it I had to go and wash my entire face just to clean up.

Totally worth it.

##Week 16 - My Sexy Face

So, as I finish the 16th week of growing a stupid beard I give you my best attempt at a sexy face. Not a funny one, no, we'll have none of that shit. This is my genuine attempt at a sexy side-stare face. Is it good?

I'll leave you to decide.

##Week 17 - 35 Weeks To Go

"When will this be over?" I ask as if I didn't already know.

"In 35 weeks," is the answer of course. Because 52 weeks is how long I decided to pursue this little endeavour of mine. An whilst my beard is, kind of, growing adequately, I'm very curious to see what will become of my hair.

Hair is meant to grow about 15 cm---6 inches---in a year, so hopefully it won't look completely stupid in November.

##Week 18 - A Beard Abroad

Feeling like my beard needed a vacation, I decided to take it abroad. Which is why this update comes from surprisingly sunny Finland, where I've treated my beard to a nice dose of beer, sauna, more beer and sleeping on an uncomfortable floor which has caused plenty of discomfort for my shoulder.

Or as I'd like to think it nowadays, I'm getting too bloody old for this shit.

##Week 19 - Got Me a Beard

I think I need to trim back the moustache a little, every time I open my mouth the moustache sneaks in there.

##Week 20 - The Arrival of Spring

The 20 week mark means it's time for another picture. I have trouble telling the difference to be honest. I've trimmed down the moustache because the moustache-to-mouth ratio was just becoming ridiculous.

	<figcaption>I sure hope it will even itself out one day.</figcaption>
</figure>

##Week 21 - Bring on the Wax

The time has come, the moustache must be kempt in its unruly ways and only one can still the raging beast within.

His name, is Percy. Percy Nobleman.

Nah, I'm just kidding. I have no idea of the [moustache wax from Percy Nobleman][wax] is *that good* but I hear good thing---does it still count as hearing when you read it online?---and I'm going to give it a try.

The 'stache will be kempt.

I'll let you know if Percy was up to the task.

##Week 22 - Stupid Beard

With half an hour to spare before the day is officially no more I'm filled with remorse over Past Carlos for deciding to update this stupid beard journal every week for 52 weeks.

Every bloody week.

God I hate Past Carlos, he's such a dumb-ass.

Which is why this week I will feature one legitimate reason to shave my stupid beard, which I will then proceed to ignore completely;

> No matter what they say, people think it’s dumb.
>
> "I like your beard," they said because they were being nice and the alternative was “Why the hell would you let pubes surround your mouth?” Everyone thinks your beard is dumb. They’ll never tell you. They value your feelings. I think you’re a twit. <cite><a href="http://www.brobible.com/lifestyle/style/article/legitimate-reasons-to-shave-beard/">Legitimate Reasons to Shave Your Stupid Beard</a>, BroBible</cite>

##Week 23 - Too Tired

I'm sorry, but I'm too tired to write anything this weekend. I'm growing my beard though so that should still count for something.

##Week 24 - Beard 2.0

For the first few months of this beard journey I would look myself in the mirror and not quite recognise the face that stared back at me.

But slowly, as time went by, the face staring back at me begun to look like mine.

And now, I can't imagine what I would look like without a beard which is going to make it very interesting once I shave again. Until them though, here's the progress report for my 24th week.

##Week 25 - Summer Beard

My first and, really, only thought, was that, "Is my beard gonna get really hot this summer? Damn it."

Which wasn't something I had thought about before watching this video.

<figure class="media-video">

##Week 26 - 180 Days of Beard

Drum roll please.

Today is a historic day. A glorious day, one might even say. But then again, those who say that may---but probably not---have a tendency to exaggerate.

Today, as I reach this of most glorious milestone, I am humbled and grateful as I gaze upon this visage of mine.

6 months with the beard that I'm inclined to still refer to as, "a stupid beard". I'd like to say that time flies, but there's been weeks when I've looked at myself and thought, "Why?"

The answer many times been a boring, "Well, you've made it this far."

I have now officially reached the halfway mark of this beard journey and what a journey it has been so far.

Just another 6 months to go then, I guess.

##Week 27 - Noodle Bowl

Someday, someday. And it will be glorious.
