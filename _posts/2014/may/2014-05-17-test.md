The Great Reveal.

POÄNGEN: De e dags att vi designers slutar håll våra klienterna in the dark and include them in the process of making, what is after all their, not your, website.

That, most cherished "trick" designers employ to keep their clients BAKOM FLÖTE and retain a sense of mysticism, of magic. Like a magician we try our best to bedazzle our clients, "Look at this pretty picture I made for you, do you like it?" As if liking it should have anything to do with their decisions.

But we were never really magicians, now were we?

For decades we, designers, have been creating static fixed-width images for a medium which at its very core is *not static*, nor is it at any fixed width. I'm of course talking about websites.

But rather than repeating and rehashing---God knows it's been done to death and hasn't made much of an impact anyway---how this is such a bad idea and how we SOMETHING SOMETHING clients expectations, I want to look deeper.

I want to answer---or at the very least, *try to answer*---the question of "Why?".

Why do we *insist* on creating these *pretty pictures* that only serve to confuse the people we are meant to <del>delight</del> <del>inspire</del> <ins>sell our services to</ins>?

At this point I suppose it should be worth repeating that I don't think I have *all* the answers, heck I might not have *any* of them. What I have, I simply curiosity to pursue the answers and bravery SOMETHING less humblebrag.

KLIENTER LITAR INT

There is this great chasm between designers and our clients, and that rift is distrust.

Simply put, clients don't trust us and can you really blame them?



> Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works. <cite>[Steve Jobs, 2003][steve]</cite>

KLIENTER KAN INT

Those who argue on the side of static mock-up with minimal client involvement---yeah, there's still those who do---insist that clients shouldn't be trusted with such sense and responsibility of making judgements and decisions on designs that *aren't finished*.

VI INKLUDERAR INT DOM ALLS I PROCESSEN. EN RÖRMOKARE LÅTER DIG STÅ BREVID OM DU VILL MEDANS HAN BERÄTTAR VAD HAN GÖR, VARFÖR HAN GÖR, VAD HAN KOMMER ATT GÖR EFTERÅT. ETC.

Whilst there's certainly *some* truth to that argument---I wouldn't trust a baker to fix my toilet either---those people tend to ignore the fact that any professional worth their salt would never ATT VA SNABB ATT HOPP TILL TILLFÄLLET. It's pointless to pursue this mythical finished state a website isn't meant to be in, it will never happen.

KLIENTER VET INT

> The web’s greatest strength, I believe, is often seen as a limitation, as a defect. It is the nature of the web to be flexible, and it should be our role as designers and developers to embrace this flexibility, and produce pages which, by being flexible, are accessible to all. <cite>[A Dao of Web Design][dao], John Allsopp, 2000</cite>

But an image does so very little


Why is it bad? it creates distance between you and client, hiding away the process you took to get to the end. it increases the distrust clients already have for our self-entitled ways of working. We pretend to be artists in a world meant for business.

why its good? clients should have a say in a process they barely understand. design by committey is never good. they might not understand just like a house doesn't look like much before the fasade has been put up, you still need the plumming before you can use the toilet.

but at least half of these "good" are remnants of time passed. Sure client don't understand but thats only because its our job to explain it to them and we never have.

solution: involve the client from day 1. make them feel as close to their design as you are. Did you notice the "their" part. Yeah, remeber that this is not for you.

I'm not a magician. I'm an engineer and a damn good one.
