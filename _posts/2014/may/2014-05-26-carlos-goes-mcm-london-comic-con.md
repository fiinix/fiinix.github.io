I've pretty sure I've just had the nerdiest weekend of my entire life. And---in true pre-release fashion---it all started on Wednesday, with the arrival of another <del>mysterious</del> <ins>Loot Crate</ins> box.

This month's theme was: Adventure, and unlike last month's theme---Dragons---I was quite looking forward to this one.

In the end, I still felt about as thrilled about the content as last time and I'm beginning to feel  like maybe Loot Crate isn't for me.

Third time is the charm, perhaps?

Though, having said that, I did really like the Zelda---featuring Link---t-shirt I got and thought it would be fitting to wear it to the this weekend's main event, [MCM London Comic Con][comic].

> MCM London Comic Con is the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>'s biggest modern popular culture event.

The previous expo had 88,000 participants and notable guests such as [Roger Craig Smith][roger] and [Troy Baker][troy]. This time, [Brian Fargo][brian]---who I sadly missed---and [Phil Lamarr][phil]---who I totally saw---was there.

Disappointingly I feel like the best stories I have, have no photos to verify their validity other than my word for it. Like the guy who was dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean film series and did an amazingly accurate cosplay including the mannerisms and swagger of Johnny Depp's portrayal.

Or the five people, all dressed in card board boxes, chasing each other as Solid Snake from the Metal Gear Solid series.

But thankfully I do have *some photos*, so without further procrastination, enjoy!

And of course, finally... the "swag".

After years of wanting one---and not buying it online for some reason---I finally snagged myself a Vault Boy t-shirt.

I also picked up a [Lucario][lucario] plushie, a  dual-type Fighting/Steel Pokémon, Lucien has been talking about for some time.

No weekend would---of course---be complete without the obligatory food shot and seeing as---lately---it's been all about the burgers I thought I would continue that tradition.

So, I finished the weekend with a quick trip to Chatham and its Maritime Food & Drink Festival, in the company of [Nick][nick] and his girlfriend Samantha, where I enjoyed one of [Odin's Cookhouse][odin] signature burgers, the Raider's Reindeer burger thus adding reindeer to the ever-growing list of animals I've had in a burger.

My viking-like apetite wasn't silenced with such a puny burger though, so I also ended up going to [Crabbie Shack][crab] to try their Soft Shelled Crab burger which was... well... interesting. I'm still not entirely sure if I liked it because, between the condiments and the batter the crab was dipped in before it was fried, I couldn't discern a lot of crab taste.

Overall though, a really <del>good</del> <ins>awesome</ins> weekend.
