Pay-Per-Inch

I recent news, Dreamwork Animation chief Jeffrey Katzenberg thinks that, in the future, we'll [watch and pay for feature films by the inch][ref].

In his own words.

> [...] A movie screen will be $15. A 75&Prime; TV will be $4.00. A smartphone will be $1.99 [...] <cite>Jeffrey Katzenberg, Entrepreneurial Leadership</cite>

I'll just give you minute to digest this *crazy idea* before I continue on to the part where I think this makes perfect sense.

See, since
