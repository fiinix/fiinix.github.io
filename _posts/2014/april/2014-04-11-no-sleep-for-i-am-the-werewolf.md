excerpt: Continuing from last week’s “I’m Definitely Too Old For This Shit” I thought I should tell you how my board game marathon went.
---
Another week has gone by. Sure feels like time is flying by---I suppose this is what it's like getting old.

Last weekend was a bit rough, as you might remember in ["I'm Definitely Too Old For This Shit"][too-old] I was going to attend a 24 hour board game marathon, with the obvious intention of sticking through *the entire event*.

Which I totally did.

But if I'm going to be honest---and I will---the hour between 06:00--07:00 is a bit hazy. I know we played Forbidden Island but I'm not entirely sure we played by the rules because I kept asking [Steve][steve] if he had already completed his turn.

A *few seconds after* he had completed his turn.

Yeah. I might have been nodding off a bit.

But don't take my word for it because you don't have to.

There's totally a video. There was a webcam set up to take a picture every 30 seconds for the entire duration of our 24 hour marathon.

So, here you go. Starting at 09:00 on Saturday all the way until Sunday morning at 09:00 when the police chased us out so they could have their <abbr title="Thomas A. Swift's electric rifle">TASER</abbr> training.

Oh, right, did I mention that the marathon was held at the Kent Police College?

And boy did we play board games. If you combine all the board games I had played up until this point, I think I still played more in one *long night* than I had before. Which is just awesome.

But all of this is of course just empty words without some actual hard data to back it up. And by "hard data" I of course mean: The vagueness that is my memory.

So, here's the board games I've now played---that I hadn't played before---and also their score, because let's face it---despite claiming otherwise I suppose I do give out scores anyway.

Then of course there's the one that got away. And by that I mean, the one game I had had my eye on but never got to play. And that game is Eldritch Horror. Luckily for me though there were others who also didn't get around to playing it but would have wanted to so I'm sure we'll get around to it at some point.

A different game---that I had been eyeing before---and *did* get to play was [Survive: Escape from Atlantis!][survive] which was about as much fun as I expected. Even though I lost the first time and tied for the win the second time.

Now, you might be asking yourself, "Did you have a favourite?", and I'm glad you did because "Yes".

I did develop a favourite that even now---as I think back---I'm filled with fond memories and a deep seated desire to play it again.

And I think that sums up last weekend. I had an awesome time and really enjoyed meeting new people---who I hope to meet again---and all of this is of course made even better by the fact that it was all for [a good cause][charity].
