It should come as no surprise to anyone that I'm a big fan of Batman, since I've expressed my love for him on a number of occasions. Which leads us to conclude that I must be eager about the upcoming release of [Batman: Arkham Knight][batman].

I must be, and I am. Of course.

I mean, what's not to like? It's like the old saying goes: "More Batman is always better than less Batman".

But just because I really like Batman doesn't mean I can't also enjoy a good parody of said Man of Bats. And of all the different parodies of Batman, my personal favourite is the one from [Pete Holmes][pete].

You should really watch it, it's really good.
