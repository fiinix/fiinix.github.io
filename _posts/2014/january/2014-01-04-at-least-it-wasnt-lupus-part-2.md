excerpt: "In which I publish the original idea I had for this year's New Year's Eve Recap."

The post you’re about to read is as I had originally envisioned it. It’s unfinished because I’m too tired to finish it and I probably never will. This is Part 2, the part that’s significantly more cheerful because that’s just how it was originally envisioned.

But sometimes things take a turn for the less cheerful and I couldn’t bring myself to pretend everything was fine when it clearly wasn’t. Which is why I decided to post both, in two very distinct parts.

[Part 1, is the story of what actually happened][lupus1] and I’ll leave it up to you if you want to read it or not.


[For three years running I’ve been looking back at the year that has been][topic]. And whilst there’s nothing wrong with this tradition, I really like breaking traditions. Which my way of saying “I’m not going to this time”. I don’t even have a particularly good reason, I just don’t feel like it. The very thought of it bores me so.

So instead of recapping what has happened throughout the year I suggest you simply go back to January and start reading from there. Yeah, I know, a lot more work for you and a lot less for me. But c’est la vie and whatnot.

What I will do, is to go give you a list. A list with a link to a post for every month, a post I cherish more than the others for that month. For whatever reason I can think of.

Yeah. This post is essentially a link-list. Because I’ve decided to be lazy this year.

In honour of this festive decision of mine, I’m calling this final post of the year:

## January
They say that gaming was better back when graphics were limited to 16 colours and more than 3 save slot—if any—were unheard of. They say that today’s youth is spoiled by shiny next-gen graphics in their murder-simulators—a.k.a whatever version Call Of Duty is at now—and lack the patience necessary to handle an old school game.

I say, “They’re right!”

I tried playing a Pokémon game this year because I happened to mention to a co-worker that I had never played any of the Pokémon games. At which point the suggested Pokémon FireRed. Using my—then—newly purchased—used—Google Nexus 7 I could emulate Gameboy Advance and enjoy the portability of a modern device—exactly like the original Gameboy Advance—without the hassle of carrying around an extra device.

I was stuck in that motherfucking Mt. Moon for weeks before a co-worker sent me a link to map so I could get out of there. After finally getting out, I made my way to the city of Cerulean only to be repeatedly defeated by Mindy—or Minty or whatever her fucking name is—at which point I said, “Fuck it,” and stopped playing Pokémon FireRed.

But other times, nostalgic gaming can be a bit more joyful, such as the case of this post.

The “good” “people” of Marmite would like us all to think that people either love or hate their product but the same thing could be said about children or kittens. “Love ‘em or hate ‘em” seems to apply to most things, expect for oral sex. Big surprise there, right?

## April
I’m still—to my own surprise—quite pleased with the resulting character from this post. I had ideas and plans to continue this series, which I why I gave it such a grandiose title but I have of course not continued it yet. But I think I will. Until then though, enjoy the fruits of my labour and whatnot.

Beije and I developed a game. It’s short and sweet—sweet in the unforgiving insta-death-y-kind-of-way—and if you haven’t tried it yet, you should. Later we released a Windows Phone version as well which you can find here.

## June
Sweet baby-stabbing Jesus I played more games than I expected this year. In a good way obviously because neither my wife or I feel like I’ve played a lot but I have and this is one of the many games I’ve played this year.

After a decade of delusions of grandeur, I finally put to rest the pressing question of whether or not I can tell the difference between Coca-Cola and Pepsi? Turns out, the answer is a resounding and disappointing “No”.
