excerpt: Sometimes, a lot can happen in a short span of time. The best way to deal with this, is to press it down into that deep dark crevice where it can fester until it kills you. No? Oh, right. No, it's the other thing you're supposed to do.

It's been awhile, hasn't it?

But not really. It's only been a week and a half. I just skipped over last week because I didn't have anything interesting to say and rather than ramble on---as I have a habit of doing---I thought I wouldn't write anything at all.

*Don't worry mom, I'm still very much alive.*

But now I'm back---not that I ever really left---and boy do I have things to tell, in...

When I said, "nothing interesting," I actually meant, "nothing I could really talk about because it wasn't really official yet".

Now, my notice has been handed in and my current co-workers have all been told and I suppose the only thing left is to tell the world. And by the "world" I of course mean "you".

## Turning Over a New Leaf

Last Friday I handed in my notice of termination of employment.

Or as one might say in people-speak: "I quit my job", which is an expression I can never quite get along with, it sounds more immediate than it really is.

But then again, "termination" isn't much better either as this conjures up images of muscle-bound Austrians with temporal displacement issues. Or maybe that's just me?

Maybe nobody says they "quit" their job anymore?

Enough of that now though as I'm sure you're all more curious to know what I'll be doing instead of Web Design.

The mind boggles at the possibilities, perhaps I've finally taken the leap to become a full-time baker with [my awesome cupcakes][cupcakes]---God knows a lot people wish I did that instead---or perhaps I'm going to [continue painting or sculpting][sculpting] again?

Haha.

Of course not. I'm going to keep making websites because websites are awesome.

But there you have it, by this time next month I will have joined the wonderful people at [Squiders][squiders].

## A Rainy Night on Drury Lane

After an 8 month delay I've finally completed the manuscript for A Rainy Night on Drury Lane. This means as soon as I finish designing the actual ebook and cover, I will be the proud, self-published author of a novella.

> Softboiled private detective Richard “Dick” Wentworth finds himself in a hardboiled conspiracy much larger than his feeble mind could ever imagine as he is forced out of an early retirement. Out of money and down on his luck he accepts another last job as he is approached by the distressed and voluptuous wife of senator McWilliams who has gone missing under mysterious circumstances.  <cite>[A Rainy Night on Drury Lane][ebook]</cite>

I'm going to have to rewrite the blurb though as Detective Wentworth isn't approached by senator McWilliams’ wife, but instead his mother. Other parts of the story has changed as well, hopefully for the better.

But I suppose we'll find that out soon enough.

And...

That's it for this weekly update.
