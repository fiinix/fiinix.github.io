excerpt: So, after having spent the entire weekend trying to come up with something to write about. But in the end, I couldn’t.

No, I’m completely serious. I couldn’t come up with anything. At all.

Friday became Saturday, that became Sunday. And Sunday morning became Sunday evening and I gave up.

So, instead of writing anything remotely interesting I will give you this.

<div>
<figure class="media-video">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/dvWGLcdI8o8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen> </iframe>
</figure>
</div>

How awesome was that?
