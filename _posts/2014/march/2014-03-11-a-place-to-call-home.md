Welcome to the new website. It's not much of a looker yet, heck, I haven't even gotten smart quotes to work yet. But I will, because these programmers quotes annoys the shit out of me.

Give it a little time and elbow grease and I'll get this heap to look like something one could call a home. I hope you don't mind the mess in the meantime, sometimes one just has to live in a bit of a mess to better understand what one wants from one's <del>life</del> <ins>website</ins>.

##A year later

Those two measly paragraphs above is all I wrote over a year ago as I blatantly launched carloseriksson.com, moving my journal from [the old Blogger+Blogspot combo][blogspot] I had been enduring for the past 7 or so years, to a brand spanking new Github+Jekyll combo.

There wasn't much of a ceremony, which was entirely the point. As an experiment in transparency I wanted to expose the messy, sometimes failure-ridden design process that we, designers, usually hide away, only to reveal when it's done---whatever *done* means.

I even put the development of the site on a [Trello board that I made available publicly][trello].

But that was a year ago.

Why does this website still look, well---for lack of better words---ugly and unfinished?

In short; Because it is.

And this is the exactly that design process that is sometimes messy and failure-ridden. Was this the plan I had back in March 2014?

No, but it happened and I would be a fool---and a fool I'm not---to not learn from this.

Looking around, you can see from the state of the website and that [Trello board I mentioned][trello] that I am nowhere near done yet. But with 234 commits in the repo, at least I'm making progress.

And I'm okay with that.

##What about the old blog?

I'm glad you asked---let's pretend you did.

One of the cards---i.e. tasks---I've set up on Trello, is to move over and archive all the entries from [fiinixdesign.blogspot.co.uk][blog] here.

Until I've moved over all of it though, I'm keeping the blog alive for posterity.

But with 382 entries left at the time of writing, I've got quite a lot of work ahead of me. I'm looking into ways of automating it but even the best tools will require manual tidying up.

And because I like naming things I've decided to call this [The Reclaimer][reclaimer].
