Welcome to the new website. It's not much of a looker yet, heck, I haven't even gotten smart quotes to work yet. But I will, because these programmers quotes annoys the shit out of me.

Give it a little time and elbow grease and I'll get this heap to look like something one could call a home. I hope you don't mind the mess in the meantime, sometimes one just has to live in a bit of a mess to better understand what one wants from <del>life</del> <ins>ones website</ins>.
